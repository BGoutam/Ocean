low dose received an active large patch and a placebo small patch for a total dose of 54
mg. Due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project, batch numbers are not provided in
this study report.
Duration of Treatment: 26 weeks of treatment
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration, Batch Number:
Matching placebo transdermal patches of 50 cm2 or 25 cm2 in area. Placebo group
received a placebo patch of each size. Due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project,
batch numbers are not provided in this study report.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:
x Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale, total of 11 items
[ADAS-Cog (11)] at Week 24
x Video-referenced Clinician’s Interview-based Impression of Change (CIBIC+) at
Week 24
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:
x ADAS-Cog (11) at Weeks 8 and 16
x CIBIC+ at Weeks 8 and 16
x Mean Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) from Week 4 to Week 24
Safety Endpoints:
x Adverse events
x Vital signs (weight, standing and supine blood pressure, heart rate)
x Laboratory evaluations
Statistical Methods:
Unless otherwise noted, hypothesis testing was evaluated at a significance level of 0.05.
Summary statistics for continuous variables included the number of observations, mean,
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Summary statistics for the
categorical variables included frequency and percentage.
The number of subjects randomized, the number of subjects in each analysis dataset, and
the disposition of subjects were tabulated by treatment group. Specific reasons for early
study discontinuation (protocol completed, lack of efficacy, and adverse event) were
compared using a Fisher’s exact test.
The baseline characteristics were summarized by treatment group and across all
treatment groups. The treatment groups were compared by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for continuous variables and by Pearson’s chi-square test for categorical
variables.
The primary analysis of the ADAS-Cog (11) or CIBIC+ at Week 24 used the efficacy
population with LOCF imputation for any missing values at Week 24. For ADAS-Cog
(11), an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to test for dose response
with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables. A

supportive analysis for the ADAS-Cog (11) used a likelihood-based repeated measures
(MMRM) analysis. For CIBIC+, an ANOVA model was used to test for dose response
with site and treatment included as independent variables. Similar analyses were
performed at Weeks 8 and 16 for ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+. Summary statistics for
ADAS-Cog (11) were also generated for each visit using the efficacy population with
LOCF imputation.
The primary analysis of mean NPI-X total score from Week 4 to Week 24 used the
efficacy population. For this endpoint, an ANCOVA model was used to test for dose
response with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables.
Average daily dose and cumulative dose at end of study was computed for each subject
based on the planned dose and the actual number of days in the study and was
summarized for each treatment group.
Treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events were summarized by
system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). The incidence of treatment
emergent events grouped under preferred terms for each active treatment were compared
to placebo using Fisher’s exact test. Additional analysis of dermatological adverse
events was conducted. The time to the first dermatological event was compared across
the treatment groups using Kaplan-Meier methods.
Hematology and clinical chemistry values were summarized at each visit week. The
number of subjects with no abnormal measure during treatment and those with at least
one abnormal measure during treatment were summarized for each lab analyte. Fisher’s
exact test was used to analyze the incidence of abnormal (high or low) measures during
the post-randomization phase. A display summarizing shifts from baseline by week in
terms of abnormality based on threshold range was provided. The data were
summarized comparing baseline and on drug categorization for each treatment group for
each week for each laboratory analyte. Shift tables summarizing whether a subject’s
status changed from baseline during the treatment period were provided for changes
based on threshold ranges and changes based on Hy’s Law. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
(CMH) tests, stratifying by status at baseline, were performed.
Vital sign data and weight were summarized by treatment group. The number and
percent of subjects receiving each concomitant medication were summarized.
Summary of Results:
Disposition:
A total of 254 subjects were randomized and entered the double-blind treatment phase.
The number of subjects randomized to each treatment arm was: 86 to placebo, 84 to the
xanomeline low dose treatment group and 84 to the xanomeline high dose treatment
group. Of the 254 subjects randomized to treatment, 118 completed the treatment phase
(Week 24), and 110 completed the study through Week 26. A statistically significantly

(p < 0.0001) higher number of subjects in the xanomeline low dose and high dose
groups (67% and 64%, respectively) prematurely discontinued from the study prior to
Week 24 as compared to the placebo group (30%). The most common reason for
discontinuation was adverse event (9% placebo subjects, 52% xanomeline low dose
subjects, 46% xanomeline high dose subjects), with a statistically significant association
between discontinuation due to adverse event and treatment group (p < 0.0001).
Efficacy Results:
A statistically significant dose response was not seen for either of the primary efficacy
endpoints, changes from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and CIBIC+ at week
24. Adjusted means for these 2 endpoints were similar for all 3 treatment groups.
Additional analyses at earlier time points showed similar results. Subgroup analyses by
gender, a sensitivity analysis for missing data, and a repeated measures analysis for
ADAS-Cog (11) also indicated lack of treatment response. The secondary efficacy
endpoint of the mean NPI-X values from Week 4 through Week 24 also did not
demonstrate a statistically significant dose response.
Safety Results:
Over 90% of subjects receiving active therapy reported at least 1 adverse event
compared to 75.6% of subjects receiving placebo. This difference is due largely to a
disproportionate number of dermatologic type events that occurred in the xanomeline
treatment groups. Approximately 73% of the subjects in either of the xanomeline
groups experienced at least one dermatologic adverse event of interest compared to
33.6% of the placebo subjects. There was a statistically significant difference
(p < 0.001) in the time to first dermatologic event between the treatment groups. There
were 3 deaths (2 in placebo group, 1 in the xanomeline low dose group) observed during
the study. None of the deaths were judged related to treatment. Aside from the deaths,
there were 3 serious adverse events reported in 3 subjects (2 in xanomeline high dose
and 1 in the xanomeline low dose group) and all were related to the nervous system.
The association between treatment group and the number of abnormal values beyond the
normal range was significant for three laboratory analytes: albumin (p = 0.042), urea
nitrogen (p = 0.023), and eosinophils (p = 0.001). The association between clinically
significant changes from the previous visit and treatment was statistically significant for
aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.045) and eosinophils (p = 0.010). The analysis of
shifts from baseline to most abnormal value could not be calculated on 19 of the
analytes. Of the remaining 11 analytes, only eosinophils showed a statistically
significant association with treatment group (p = 0.044). There was no significant
association with treatment group in the Hy’s law analyses examining shifts in
transaminase levels, and transaminase and total bilirubin levels between baseline values
and values while on treatment.
Changes from baseline in vital signs (SBP, DBP, and pulse), at the Week 24 and end of
treatment assessments, were generally small decreases. Changes from baseline in

weight, at the Week 24 and end of treatment assessments, however, were generally
small with no treatment-related pattern of increases or decreases.
Conclusions:
A statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups
withdrew prematurely from the study as compared to the placebo group. This is largely
due to the higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups experiencing a
dermatologic event and subsequently resulting in premature withdrawal from the study.
This further hindered the study’s ability to demonstrate efficacy.
A statistically significant dose response was not seen for both of the primary efficacy
endpoints, change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and CIBIC+ at Week
24, and for the secondary efficacy endpoint, mean NPI-X values from Week 4 to Week
24. Adjusted means for all 3 endpoints were similar across all treatment groups.
There were an increased number of dermatologic adverse events reported in the active
treatment groups as compared to the placebo group. There were 3 serious adverse
events. In addition, there were 3 deaths that were deemed unrelated to treatment.
For the laboratory data, subjects in both the xanomeline low and high dose groups
showed more observations above normal range than the placebo group. Albumin was
more often lower than the normal range for subjects in the placebo and xanomeline low
dose group. Subjects in the xanomeline treatment groups had statistically significantly
more values above the normal range than subjects in the placebo group for both urea
nitrogen and eosinophils. There was a statistically significant association between
clinically significant changes from the previous visit and treatment group for aspartate
aminotransferase and eosinophils. Shifts from baseline for eosinophils were statistically
significant with both xanomeline treatment groups showing more changes from normal
to above normal than the placebo group. There was no significant association with
treatment group in the Hy’s law analysis examining shifts in liver function tests between
baseline values and values while on treatment.
There were only minor changes from baseline in vital signs and weight at Week 24.

INTRODUCTION

The objective of the CDISC SDTM/ADaM Pilot Project is to demonstrate the effective
transformation of legacy data into CDISC SDTM domains and ADaM datasets and their
associated metadata. The Project team will produce a “pilot submission” that will be
delivered to FDA reviewers for their evaluation in a mock review, assessing whether data
submitted to the FDA using the CDISC Standard will meet the needs and expectations of
both medical and statistical FDA reviewers. This abbreviated study report documents the
analysis results of the legacy data for this first pilot submission.
The legacy data being used in CDISCPILOT01 were provided by Eli Lilly and Company
(Legacy Sponsor) for the purposes of this CDISC Pilot Project. The data were
de-identified and documents were redacted prior to release to the CDISC Pilot Project
team. De-identification included changing dates and shifting them into the future. All
chronological relationships and sequences were maintained within the data elements for a
subject (e.g., no change in the relationship of timing of adverse events with respect to
dosing). The submission did not reproduce all of the Legacy Sponsor’s analyses and
reports. Instead only the more common elements of a submission were addressed. These
included safety data, the primary efficacy endpoints and a few secondary efficacy
endpoints. Deviations from the protocol-specified analyses are described in the statistical
analysis plan created specifically for this study as part of the CDISC Pilot Project
(Appendix 9).

STUDY OBJECTIVES

The primary objectives of this study were:
x To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 error
rate, D=0.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+
scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]).
x To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.
A secondary objective of this study was:
x To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the
Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
areas.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN

9.1.

Overall Study Design and Plan

This study was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group study. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of transdermal xanomeline, 50 cm2 and 75 cm2, and placebo in subjects with
mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.
Xanomeline or placebo was administered daily in the morning, with the application of
two adhesive patches, one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25 cm2 in area. Doses were measured
in terms of the xanomeline base, and were 54 mg for the 50 cm2 patch and 27 mg for the
25 cm2 patch. Placebo was identical in appearance to the primary study material. The
total doses being compared are therefore 0 (both patches placebo), 54 mg (large patch
active drug, small patch placebo), and 81 mg (both patches active drug). The treatment
groups referred to throughout this report will be “xanomeline high dose,” “xanomeline
low dose,” and “placebo”.
Subjects were males or females of non-childbearing potential, 50 years of age or older,
had probable mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease according to the NINCDS-ADRDA
criteria, and an MMSE score of 10 to 23. The duration of treatment was 26 weeks, with
24 weeks of active treatment. Approximately 300 subjects were to be enrolled and
randomized equally to xanomeline high dose, xanomeline low dose, or placebo.
Subjects were assessed for efficacy using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale of 11 items [ADAS-Cog (11)], video-referenced Clinician’s
Interview-based Impression of Change (CIBIC+), and Revised Neuropsychiatric
Inventory (NPI-X). Safety assessments include reporting of adverse events, laboratory
values, and vital signs.
The schema for this study is illustrated in Figure 9-1. Additional study design details are
described in the study protocol (Appendix 1).

Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control
Groups

This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the low and high dose
xanomeline relative to placebo in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.
Subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low dose and
xanomeline high dose. Two patches were administered to each subject in a double-blind
fashion to minimize investigator and subject bias. Placebo was the control group used in
this study.

9.3.

Selection of Study Population

Subjects were included in the study if they were males or females of non-childbearing
potential, 50 years of age or older, had probable mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease
according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, had an MMSE score of 10 to 23, had a

Treatments

Subjects were randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low or
high dose. Xanomeline or placebo was administered daily in the morning, with the
application of two adhesive patches, one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25 cm2 in area. Doses
were measured in terms of the xanomeline base, and were 54 mg for the 50 cm2 patch and
27 mg for the 25 cm2 patch. Placebo was identical in appearance to the primary study
material. Xanomeline high dose group received an active patch of each size and the
xanomeline low dose received an active large patch and a placebo small patch. The total
doses being compared are therefore 0 (both patches placebo), 54 mg (large patch active
drug, small patch placebo), and 81 mg (both patches active drug). The treatment groups
referred to throughout this report will be “xanomeline high dose,” “xanomeline low
dose,” and “placebo”.

Efficacy and Safety Variables

Efficacy in this study was assessed using Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Video-referenced Clinician’s Interview-based
Impression of Change (CIBIC+), and Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X). The
ADAS-Cog is an established measure of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease. This
study will specifically use an 11-item subscale of the ADAS-Cog, denoted as
ADAS-Cog (11). The CIBIC+ is an assessment of the global clinical status relative to
baseline and utilizes semi-structured interviews with the subject and the caregiver. The
NPI-X is an assessment of change in psychopathology in subjects with dementia and is
administered to the designated caregiver. Methods for scoring the ADAS-Cog (11),
CIBIC+, and NPI-X are noted in the statistical analysis plan (Appendix 9).
Safety in this study was assessed with the reporting of adverse events, laboratory
measures, and vital signs. The list of laboratory measures is noted in the study protocol
(Appendix 1).
The schedule of efficacy and safety assessments is listed in the study protocol (Appendix
1). Additional efficacy and safety assessments were utilized in this protocol, but were not
included in this study report due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project.

The following baseline characteristics were summarized by treatment group and across
all treatment groups: age, age category (<65, 65-80, >80), sex, race, Mini-Mental State
(MMSE), duration of Alzheimer's disease, years of education, weight, height, BMI, and
BMI category (BMI<25, BMI 25-<30, BMI>=30). The treatment groups were compared
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and by Pearson’s chi-square
test for categorical variables.
9.7.1.3.

Efficacy

The primary analysis of the ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 used the efficacy population
with LOCF imputation for any missing values at Week 24. An ANCOVA model was
used with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables.
Treatment was included as a continuous variable, and results for a test of dose response
were produced. If the test for dose response was statistically significant, pairwise
comparisons among the 3 groups were to be performed and evaluated at a significance
level of 0.05. Similar analyses were performed at Weeks 8 and 16. Summary statistics
were generated for each visit using the efficacy population with LOCF imputation.
A supportive analysis for the ADAS-Cog (11) used a likelihood-based repeated measures
(MMRM) analysis. In this analysis for the change from baseline in the ADAS-Cog (11)
at Week 24, the independent variables included in the model were the fixed, categorical
effects of treatment, site, time (week), and treatment by time interaction along with the
continuous effects of baseline ADAS-Cog (11) score and baseline ADAS-Cog (11) score
by time interaction.
The primary analysis of CIBIC+ at Week 24 used the efficacy population with LOCF
imputation for any missing values at Week 24. For this endpoint, an ANOVA model was
used with site, and treatment included as independent variables. Treatment was included
as a continuous variable, and results for a test of dose response were produced. If the test
for dose response was statistically significant, pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups
were to be performed and evaluated at a significance level of 0.05. Similar analyses were
performed at Weeks 8 and 16.
The primary analysis of mean NPI-X total score from Week 4 to Week 24 used the
efficacy population. This endpoint was calculated as the mean of all available total
scores between Weeks 4 and 24, inclusive. For this endpoint, an ANCOVA model was
used with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables.
Treatment was included as a continuous variable, and results for a test of dose response
were produced. If the test for dose response was statistically significant, pairwise
comparisons among the 3 groups were to be performed and evaluated at a significance

Safety

Average daily dose and cumulative dose at end of study (Week 26 or early termination)
was computed for each subject based on the planned dose and the actual number of days
in the study and was summarized for each treatment group.
Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA. Due to the nature of the CDISC Pilot
Project, the higher level terms and higher level group terms of the MedDRA coding were
masked. In addition, no numeric MedDRA codes are included in the databases.
Treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events were summarized by SOC
(system organ class) and preferred term (PT). The incidence of treatment emergent
events grouped under preferred terms for each active treatment were compared to placebo
using Fisher’s exact test.
Additional analysis of dermatological adverse events was conducted. A category of
special events was created to identify the events that were considered dermatological
events. These events were determined by a thorough review of blinded coded adverse
event terms and all preferred terms that were considered to be dermatologic in nature,
such as rash, pruritus, or dermatitis, were flagged as adverse events of special interest.
The time to the first dermatological event was compared across the treatment groups
using Kaplan-Meier methods. Graphical displays of the survival curves were produced.
Hematology and clinical chemistry values were summarized at each visit week, for each
analyte, for each treatment group. Four assessments of abnormality were identified for
each laboratory analyte:
x Values outside the normal range
x Values significantly beyond the normal range (i.e., outside the threshold range)
x Values differing significantly from values at the previous scheduled visit,
x Abnormal values as defined by Hy’s Law
The number of subjects with no abnormal measure during treatment and those with at
least one abnormal measure during treatment were summarized for each lab analyte.
Two tables were provided – one defining abnormal as beyond normal range (i.e., below
LLN or above ULN) and the other defining abnormal as a clinically significant change
from the previous visit. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the incidence of abnormal
(high or low) measures during the post-randomization phase.
A display summarizing shifts from baseline by week in terms of abnormality based on
threshold range was provided. The data were summarized using sets of 3-by-3 matrices
comparing baseline and on drug categorization for each treatment group for each week
for each laboratory analyte.
Shift tables summarizing whether a subject’s status changed from baseline during the
treatment period were provided for changes based on threshold ranges and changes based
on Hy’s Law. Two variations of the modified Hy’s Law criteria were used in the

assessment. The first considered subjects with transaminase (ALT or AST) elevations of
greater than 1.5 times ULN as abnormal. The second further narrowed the assessment of
abnormality to require total bilirubin elevations to be greater than 1.5 times ULN in
addition to transaminase elevations of greater than 1.5 times ULN. In these tables a
subject was categorized as normal or abnormal (i.e., outside the threshold range) at
baseline. During the treatment phase, the most extreme value was used to categorize a
subject as normal or abnormal during the treatment phase. The shift table shows the
number of subjects whose on treatment categorization was the same or shifted from the
baseline categorization. The treatment period was defined as any planned visit after Week
0 (Visit 3), up to and including Week 24 (Visit 12). Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)
tests, stratifying by status at baseline, were performed.
Vital sign data (blood pressure supine, blood pressure standing 1 minute, blood pressure
standing 3 minutes, heart rate supine, heart rate standing 1 minute, and heart rate standing
3 minutes) at baseline, week 24 and end of treatment (last visit on or before week 24
visit) was summarized by treatment group. Change from baseline was also summarized.
Weight data at baseline and Week 24 (with and without including early terminations) was
summarized by treatment group. Change from baseline was also summarized.
The concomitant medication data were coded using a publicly available sample of WHO
Drug. The data were matched to a preferred term and an anatomical class (ATC level 1).
Drugs not matching those in the sample were considered “uncoded” for the purposes of
this submission. Due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project, drugs were matched to
only one class. The number and percent of subjects receiving each concomitant
medication were summarized. Concomitant medications were reported by anatomical
class and ingredient. Medications were sorted in descending order of total incidence
across treatment groups for anatomical class and in descending order of total incidence
for the ingredient within each anatomical class. If the total incidence for any two or more
ingredients is equal, the events were presented in alphabetical order.
9.7.2.

Determination of Sample Size

Approximately 100 subjects were to be randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups.
Previous experience with the oral formulation of xanomeline suggested that this sample
size had 90% power to detect a 3.0 mean treatment difference in ADAS-Cog (p < 0.05,
two-sided), based on a standard deviation of 6.5. Furthermore, this sample size had 80%
power to detect a 0.36 mean treatment difference in CIBIC+ (p < 0.05, two-sided), based
on a standard deviation of 0.9.

Changes in Study Conduct or Planned Analyses

The protocol was amended 3 times. For the first 2 amendments, changes were made to
the ambulatory ECG assessments. These changes included shortening the duration of the
ambulatory ECG monitoring from 48 to 24 hours prior to visit 3, adding monitoring prior
to visit 4, removing monitoring prior to visit 6, and subsequently removing the
monitoring prior to visit 4. During the time the additional monitoring prior to visit 4 was
required, a visit (designated as visit 3e) was added for the placement of the ambulatory
ECG equipment. Other changes in the study conduct are not described in this study
report due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project.
Changes to the protocol-specified analyses are described in the statistical analysis plan

Disposition of Subjects

CDISCPILOT01

Table 14-1.01 provides a summary of the subjects in each analysis population. A total of
306 subjects have demographic information in the study tabulation database
(Figure 10-1). Fifty-two (52) subjects were not randomized, and thus were screen
failures. The remaining 254 subjects were randomized and entered the double-blind
treatment phase. These subjects comprise the Intent-to-Treat population. The number of
subjects randomized to each treatment arm was: 86 to placebo, 84 to the xanomeline low
dose treatment group and 84 to the xanomeline high dose treatment group. Of the 254
subjects randomized to treatment, 118 completed the treatment phase (Week 24), and 110
completed the study through Week 26.

Table 14-1.03 summarizes the disposition of the population by site. The table provides
the number of subjects randomized and completing Week 24, per treatment group, for
each site. Of the 17 sites participating in the study, 7 met the pre-specified criteria for
small sample sizes, requiring them to be grouped together for the purposes of analyses
including site as a covariate, as shown in Table 14-1.03.
A total of 136 subjects prematurely discontinued from the study prior to Week 24.
Table 14-1.02 provides a summary of the reasons for premature discontinuation for these
subjects. There was a statistically significant association between the number of subjects
discontinuing the study and the treatment group (p < 0.0001), with 30% of placebo
subjects terminating early as compared to 67% of the xanomeline low dose subjects, and
64% of the xanomeline high dose subjects. The most common reason for discontinuation
was adverse event (9% placebo subjects, 52% xanomeline low dose subjects, 46%
xanomeline high dose subjects), with a statistically significant association between
discontinuation due to adverse event and treatment group (p < 0.0001).

Data Sets Analyzed

Table 14-1.01 provides the summary of study populations analyzed in this protocol.
Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment groups at Week 0 (Visit 3). All subjects
who were randomized comprised the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population. A total of 254
subjects (86 in the placebo group; 84 in the xanomeline low dose group; 84 in the
xanomeline high dose group) were randomized.
All subjects randomized and known to have taken at least one dose of randomized drug
were included in the Safety Population. Of the 254 subjects randomized, all took a dose
of the randomized study drug and were included in the Safety Population. Note that the
first patches were applied at the randomization visit.
All subjects who were randomized and took at least one dose of randomized drug (i.e.,
were in the Safety Population), and have at least one post-baseline measure for both
ADAS-Cog and CIBIC+ were included in the Efficacy Population. Twenty (20) of the
subjects in Safety Population did not have a post-randomization ADAS-Cog assessment
and a post-randomization CIBIC+ assessment, thus 234 subjects (79 placebo; 81
xanomeline low dose; 74 xanomeline high dose) comprised the Efficacy Population.
The 118 subjects (60 placebo; 28 xanomeline low dose; 30 xanomeline high dose) who
were in the Efficacy Population and completed their Week 24 visit (Visit 12) comprised
the Completers Population. Eight (8) subjects discontinued between Week 24 and Week
26, leaving 110 subjects (58 placebo; 25 xanomeline low dose; 27 xanomeline high dose)
who completed the study.

Efficacy Results

There are 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints in this study: the change from baseline in
ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and the CIBIC+ score at Week 24. Hypothesis testing for
both of these endpoints considered whether there is a statistically significant dose
response among the 3 treatment groups. The significance level for each of these
endpoints is 0.05.
11.4.1.

ADAS-Cog (11)

Table 14-3.01 presents the summary statistics for baseline and Week 24 values for
ADAS-Cog (11) and the change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24. These
results are based on the efficacy population with LOCF imputation. The mean scores
across all 3 treatment groups are similar at baseline with the similar worsening in scores
by Week 24. Accordingly, the dose response for the change from baseline at Week 24,
adjusted for site and baseline score is not statistically significantly different from 0.
Pairwise comparisons among the treatment groups are also presented in Table 14-3.01,
but should not be considered since the dose response analysis was not statistically
significant.
Similar analyses were performed at Weeks 8 and 16 (Table 14-3.03 and Table 14-3.05).
Likewise, no dose response was seen at these earlier time points.
To check the robustness of the imputation method, a sensitivity analysis using only the
observed values was performed (Table 14-3.07). Although the xanomeline low dose
group had a smaller mean change from baseline at Week 24, the dose response in this
analysis was also not statistically significantly different from 0.
Subgroup analyses by gender were also performed using the LOCF-imputed values
(Table 14-3.08 and Table 14-3.09). The males in the xanomeline low dose group had a
mean change from baseline that was higher than the other 2 groups, but the dose response
was not statistically significantly. The dose response in the female subgroup was
trending in a positive direction (p = 0.094) indicating that higher doses may result in
smaller changes by Week 24. Mean (SD) changes from baseline at Week 24 for the
placebo, xanomeline low dose, and xanomeline high dose were 3.0 (5.57), 1.7 (5.54), and
1.1 (4.77), respectively.
Summary statistics for the actual values and the change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11)
are presented in Table 14-3.10 for both the observed values by visit window and LOCFimputed values.
A repeated measures analysis was performed on ADAS-Cog (11) using postbaseline
changes from baseline (Table 14-3.11) to examine treatment effect over time. Covariates
included in the model were treatment, site, time, treatment by time interaction, baseline

score, and baseline by time interaction. Adjusted means for the change from baseline at
Week 24 were similar across the 3 treatment groups. Pairwise comparisons among the 3
treatment groups were not statistically significantly different.
11.4.2.

CIBIC+

Table 14-3.02 presents the summary statistics for the Week 24 values for CIBIC+. These
results are based on the efficacy population with LOCF imputation. The mean scores
across all 3 treatment groups are similar at Week 24. Accordingly, the dose response for
the CIBIC+ score at Week 24, adjusted for site is not statistically significantly different
from 0. Pairwise comparisons among the treatment groups are also presented in Table
14-3.02, but should not be considered since the dose response analysis was not
statistically significant.
Similar analyses were performed at Weeks 8 and 16 (Table 14-3.04 and Table 14-3.06).
Likewise, no dose response was seen at these earlier time points.
An analysis not specified in the protocol was performed considering CIBIC+ scores as a
categorical variable (Table 14-3.13). This analysis used the LOCF-imputed values and
compared treatment groups at Weeks 8, 16, and 24. Distributions of scores between the 3
treatment groups were not statistically significantly different.
11.4.3.

NPI-X

Table 14-3.12 presents the summary statistics for the baseline NPI-X score and for the
mean of the observed values from Weeks 4 to 24, inclusive. The mean NPI-X value at
baseline for the xanomeline high dose group was slightly larger than the other 2 groups.
The dose response for the mean of the Week 4 through Week 24 values, adjusted for site
and baseline value, was not statistically significantly different from 0. Pairwise
comparisons among the treatment groups are also presented in Table 14-3.12, but should
not be considered since the dose response analysis was not statistically significant.

11.5.

Efficacy Conclusions

A statistically significant dose response was not seen for either of the primary efficacy
endpoints: changes from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and CIBIC+ at Week
24. Adjusted means for these 2 endpoints were similar for all 3 treatment groups.
Additional analyses at earlier time points showed similar results. Subgroup analyses by
gender, a sensitivity analysis for missing data, and a repeated measures analysis for
ADAS-Cog (11) also indicated lack of treatment response. The secondary efficacy
endpoint of the mean NPI-X values from Week 4 through Week 24 also did not
demonstrate a statistically significant dose response.

SAFETY EVALUATION

12.1.

Extent of Exposure

For the purposes of this submission, planned exposure was summarized. It was assumed
that while the subject was in the study the subject took the randomized drug as planned,
with the first dose occurring on the date of randomization (Week 0), and the new dose
levels occurring on the day following the Week 2 visit and the Week 24 visit. The date
of last dose was that indicated on the CRF. If no date of last dose was available, the date
of discontinuation was assumed to be the date of last dose.
A total of 254 subjects received randomized drug during the study. Eighty-six (86)
subjects received placebo, 84 received xanomeline low dose and 84 received xanomeline
high dose. The mean daily dose was 54.0 mg and 71.6 mg for the low dose and high dose
treatment groups, respectively, as shown in Table 14-4.01.

12.2.

Adverse Events

12.2.1.

Brief Summary of Adverse Events

A summary of total adverse events across all body systems showed an increase in adverse
events associated with randomized drug with over 90% of subjects receiving active
therapy reporting at least one adverse event compared to 75.6% of subjects receiving
placebo (Table 14-5.01). However, this difference is due largely to a disproportionate
number of dermatologic type events that occurred in the xanomeline treatment groups.
Therefore, with the exception of dermatologic irritation (discussed below), the overall
adverse event profile does not suggest that there is a specific hazard associated with
either dose of xanomeline.
The number of serious adverse events reported during this study were minimal
(Table 14-5.02) and do not suggest that there is any pattern attributable to active therapy.
There were 3 deaths observed during the course of the study, yet none of these were
flagged as being serious events.

Analysis of Adverse Events

The adverse event profile of the treatment groups was generally similar across the
treatment groups. With the exception of skin related adverse events, discussed below, the
most commonly reported events (reported by t 5% of subjects in any treatment group)
were reported in numerous body systems and did not show a consistent treatment
dependent pattern. There were noted differences (p < 0.150) between placebo and at least
one of the active therapy groups in the incidence of sinus bradycardia (2.3% placebo,
8.3% low dose, and 9.5% high dose), fatigue (1.2% placebo, 6.0% xanomeline low dose,
6.0% xanomeline high dose), dizziness (2.3% placebo, 9.5% xanomeline low dose,
13.1% xanomeline high dose), cough (1.2% placebo, 6.0% xanomeline low dose, 6.0%
xanomeline high dose), and hyperhiridosis (2.3% placebo, 4.8% xanomeline low dose,
9.5% xanomeline high dose). Upper respiratory tract infection was reported more
frequently in the placebo group (7.0%) compared with the xanomeline low dose group
(1.2%, p < 0.150) but not the xanomeline high dose group (3.6%).

Analysis of Death, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other
Significant Adverse Events

12.3.1.

Deaths

There were 3 deaths reported during the conduct of this study with 2 subjects in the
placebo group and 1 subject randomized to xanomeline low dose. None of these deaths
were recorded as serious adverse events yet two of the deaths were clearly of serious
nature (myocardial infarction and sudden death) and the other death being a suicide.
None of the deaths were judged related to treatment.
12.3.2.

Other Serious Adverse Events

There were a total of 3 serious adverse events reported in 3 individual subjects, 2 of
whom were in the xanomeline high dose and 1 in the xanomeline low dose group
(Table 14-5.02). All 3 events were events related to the nervous system. Due to the low
numbers of serious adverse events, it is not possible to make any conclusions regarding
the relationship of these events and treatment group.
12.3.3.

Dermatologic Adverse Events

A special category of dermatologic events was created prior to unblinding. This category
combines all adverse events that were considered to be of dermatologic importance after
a thorough medical review of the coded adverse events. The preferred terms listed in
Table 12-2 were included in this category of special interest adverse events.

As shown on the table at the bottom of Figure 14-1, there was a disproportionate number
of subjects in the xanomeline treatment groups who experienced a special interest
dermatologic adverse event with 74% (n = 62) of xanomeline low dose and 73% (n = 61)
of xanomeline high dose subjects with at least one event of special interest compared to
34% (n = 29) of placebo subjects. This high rate of dermatologic events most likely
contributed to the larger proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups who
discontinued the study due to an adverse event (Table 14-1.02).
An analysis of the time to the first dermatologic event indicated that the median time to
first event was significantly different (p<0.0001) between treatment groups with a median
time of 33 days in the xanomeline low dose group (95% CI: 27 – 48 days) and 36 days in
the xanomeline high dose group (95% CI: 24 – 46 days) compared to placebo, in which
the median time to first event was not estimable (Figure 14-1).

Narratives of Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events and Certain
Other Significant Adverse Events

Narratives for subjects who died while on-study are included below. Narratives for
subjects who reported other serious adverse events or other significant adverse events are
not included in this study report due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project.
Subject 01-701-1211, a 76-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s dementia, began receiving
xanomeline low dose on 15 November 2012. The subject was diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s dementia in 2010. The subject also had non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, which was considered to be mild in severity. The subject experienced sudden
death on 14 January 2013. This death was considered by the investigator to be unrelated
to study medication. No action was taken for this event and study medication was not
discontinued prior to death. Eight other adverse events were reported for this subject yet
none were classified as being serious and none appeared to contribute to the sudden
death.
Subject 01-701-1445, a 75-year-old man with Alzheimer’s dementia, began receiving
placebo on 11 May 2014. The subject was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia in
2012. The subject also suffered from mild forms of non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. This
subject committed suicide on 31 October 2014. This death was considered by the
investigator to be unrelated to study medication. No action was taken for this event and
study medication was not discontinued prior to death. No other adverse events were
reported by this subject.
Subject 01-701-1083, an 89-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s dementia, began receiving
placebo on 22 July 2013. The subject was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia in 2011.
This subject had previous history of cardiovascular disease: implanted cardiac
pacemaker, first degree atrioventricular block, and a history of myocardial infarction and

angina pectoris in 2006. The subject experienced a fatal myocardial infarction on
2 August 2013. This event required hospitalization. The event was considered by the
investigator to be possibly related to study medication. No action was taken for this
event and study medication was not discontinued prior to death. No other adverse events
were reported by this subject.

12.4.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

Table 14-6.01 to Table 14-6.05 summarize the findings for the laboratory data analysis.
Commonly used laboratory analytes (as defined by the CDISC coding document) that
were measured with sufficient frequency were reported. Hematology analytes that meet
this criterion are: hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean
corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC),
leukocyte count, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelet count, and
erythrocyte count. Clinical chemistry analytes that meet this criterion are: sodium,
potassium, chloride, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase
(GGT, GGPT, SGGT, YGGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, inorganic
phosphorus, calcium, non-fasting glucose, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, and
creatine phosphokinase. Urinalysis and other lab data were not summarized, but were
included in the tabulation datasets.
The hematology and clinical chemistry measures were summarized for baseline and
Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 26 (visits 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13,
respectively). The baseline values were those collected at Week -2 (visit 1). Table 146.01 presents summaries of these results by week. This table provides descriptive
statistics (n, mean, and standard deviation) for the measured value in standard units as
well as the change from baseline. The change from baseline laboratory value was
calculated as the difference between the baseline lab value and the endpoint value (i.e.,
the value at the specified visit) or the end of treatment observation. These results are
shown by treatment group.
Table 14-6.02 and Table 14-6.03 summarize each laboratory value, including the baseline
value, as categorized with reference to the lab normal range as
x “L” - less than or equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN)
x “N” – Greater than the LLN and less than the upper limit of normal (ULN)
x “H” – Greater than or equal to the ULN
Laboratory values were assigned a flag of abnormal (high or low) if the value was outside
the threshold range (defined as significantly beyond the normal range, i.e., > 1.5 times
ULN or < 0.5 times LLN) or if the value was significantly different from the value
observed at the preceding scheduled visit (i.e., absolute value of the change from

CDISCPILOT01

previous value is larger than the 50% of the normal range, LLN to ULN). Shift tables
summarizing whether a subject’s status changed from baseline at each week of treatment
and during the treatment period are provided based on threshold ranges and changes
based on Hy’s Law. Two variations of the modified Hy’s Law criteria were used in the
assessment. The first considered subjects with transaminase (ALT or AST) elevations of
greater than 1.5 times ULN as abnormal. The second further narrowed the assessment of
abnormality to require total bilirubin elevations to be greater than 1.5 times ULN in
addition to transaminase elevations of greater than 1.5 times ULN. In these tables
subjects were categorized as normal or abnormal (i.e., outside the threshold range) at
baseline. During the treatment phase, the most extreme value was used to categorize a
subject as normal or abnormal during the treatment phase. The shift table shows the
number of subjects whose on treatment categorization was the same or shifted from the
baseline categorization. The treatment phase is defined as any planned visit after Week 0
(Visit 3), up to and including Week 24 (Visit 12).
The number of subjects with no abnormal measure during treatment and those with at
least one abnormal measure during treatment are summarized for each lab analyte.
Table 14-6.02 provides an analysis with abnormal as beyond normal range (i.e., below
LLN or above ULN). Table 14-6.03 provides the analysis based on abnormal as a
clinically significant change from the previous visit.
As shown in Table 14-6.02, only three laboratory analytes were statistically significantly
associated with treatment group: albumin (p = 0.042), urea nitrogen (p = 0.023), and
eosinophils (p = 0.001). There were four additional analytes that were nearly significant:
chloride (p = 0.058), hematocrit (p = 0.052), hemoglobin (p = 0.093), and MCV
(p = 0.077). Albumin was more often lower than normal range for subjects in the placebo
and xanomeline low dose groups. Subjects in the xanomeline treatment groups had
statistically significantly more values above the normal range than subjects in the placebo
group for urea nitrogen [placebo=9 (11%), xanomeline low dose group =22 (27%),
xanomeline high dose group=12 (15%)] and eosinophils [placebo=0, xanomeline low
dose group =11 (13%), xanomeline high dose group=7 (9%)].
Table 14-6.03 shows the number of clinically significant changes from previous visit by
treatment group for each analyte. The association between clinically significant change
from the previous visit and treatment was statistically significant for aspartate
aminotransferase (p = 0.045) and eosinophils (p = 0.010). Nearly significant were
protein (p = 0.062) and monocytes (p = 0.081).
Table 14-6.04 summarizes shifts from baseline by week in terms of abnormality based on
threshold range. The data in this table were summarized using sets of 3-by-3 tables
comparing baseline and on drug categorization for each treatment group for each week
for each laboratory analyte. Because no subjects were abnormally low at baseline, only
the normal at baseline and high at baseline data are shown.

In Table 14-6.05, a CMH test, stratifying by status at baseline, is shown. This test was
performed to assess the association of significant shifts from baseline for each analyte
with treatment group. The number of subjects with no abnormal measure during
treatment and those with at least one abnormal measure during treatment was
summarized for each lab analyte. Nineteen of the 30 analytes could not be analyzed
because they had less than two non-missing levels. Of the 11 remaining analytes, only
shifts from baseline to treatment phase for eosinophils were statistically significantly
related to treatment group (p = 0.044). For eosinophils, the number of subjects in each
group that showed a shift from normal to high were 0 in the placebo group, 5 (6%) in the
xanomeline low dose group, and 6 (8%) in the xanomeline high dose group.
Finally, Table 14-6.06 reports the results of the Hy’s Law analysis. Of the cases where
transaminase was greater than 1.5 times ULN, 3 subjects in the placebo group, 1 in the
xanomeline low dose, and 3 in the xanomeline high dose shifted from normal at baseline
to above normal during treatment. In addition, 2 subjects in the placebo group and 1 in
the xanomeline low dose group had an elevated transaminase at baseline that remained
high during treatment, and 1 subject in the xanomeline low dose group had an elevated
transaminase at baseline that became normal during treatment. There were no subjects in
the xanomeline treatment groups and 1 subject in the placebo group who had both
transaminase levels greater than 1.5 times ULN and total bilirubin greater than 1.5 times
ULN. A CMH test for an association with treatment group was not statistically
significant for either Hy’s law assessment.

Vital Signs and Weight

Vital signs and weight were to be collected for all subjects at each visit. For the purposes
of this submission, vital signs were summarized only for baseline and Week 24 and end
of treatment. End of treatment is defined to be the last on-treatment assessment of the
specified measure.
12.5.1.

Vital Signs Summary

Table 14-7.01 presents a summary of the vital sign data (systolic blood pressure [SBP],
diastolic blood pressure [DBP] and pulse) collected at baseline (Week 0), Week 24, and
end of treatment.
Table 14-7.02 summarizes the changes in vital signs at Week 24 and end of treatment as
compared to values at the baseline visit (Week 0).
Table 12-3 presents summary statistics for SBP, DBP, and pulse after standing for 3
minutes. These assessments are representative of the vitals taken at other positions and
time points in terms of the relationships among treatment groups. Measurements were
also taken after the subject had been lying down for 5 minutes and after the subject had

been standing for 1 minute. The largest change from baseline occurred in the assessments
taken after the subject had been standing for 3 minutes.
Vital sign values at baseline were comparable across treatment groups. Changes from
baseline, at the Week 24 and end of treatment assessments, were generally small
decreases.

Concomitant Medications

Table 14-7.04 shows that use of concomitant medications was similar across the 3
treatment groups. Concomitant medications were taken by 77 (90%), 74 (88%), and 78
(93%) subjects in the placebo, xanomeline low dose, and xanomeline high dose groups,
respectively.
The most common concomitant medication (based on coded term) used by xanomeline
subjects in this study was hydrocortisone, which was taken by 2 (2%), 13 (15%), and 8
(10%) subjects in the placebo, xanomeline low dose, and xanomeline high dose groups,
respectively.

Safety Conclusions

Over 90% of subjects receiving active therapy reported at least 1 adverse event compared
to 75.6% of subjects receiving placebo. This difference is due largely to a
disproportionate number of dermatologic type events that occurred in the xanomeline
treatment groups. Approximately 73% of the subjects in either of the xanomeline groups
experienced at least one dermatologic adverse event of interest compared to 33.6% of the
placebo subjects. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) in the time
to first dermatologic event between the treatment groups. There were 3 deaths (2 in
placebo group, 1 in the xanomeline low dose group) observed during the study. None of
the deaths were judged related to treatment. Aside from the deaths, there were 3 serious
adverse events reported in 3 subjects (2 in xanomeline high dose and 1 in the xanomeline
low dose group) and all were related to the nervous system.
The association between treatment group and the number of abnormal values beyond the
normal range was significant for three laboratory analytes: albumin (p = 0.042), urea
nitrogen (p = 0.023), and eosinophils (p = 0.001). The association between clinically
significant changes from the previous visit and treatment was statistically significant for
aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.045) and eosinophils (p = 0.010). The analysis of shifts
from baseline to most abnormal value could not be calculated on 19 of the analytes. Of
the remaining 11 analytes, only eosinophils showed a statistically significant association
with treatment group (p = 0.044). There was no significant association with treatment
group in the Hy’s law analyses examining shifts in transaminase levels, and transaminase
and total bilirubin levels between baseline values and values while on treatment.
Changes from baseline in vital signs (SBP, DBP, and pulse), at the Week 24 and end of
treatment assessments, were generally small decreases. Changes from baseline in weight,
at the Week 24 and end of treatment assessments, however, were generally small with no
treatment-related pattern of increases or decreases.

DISCUSSION OF STUDY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

A statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups
withdrew prematurely from the study as compared to the placebo group. This is largely
due to the higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups experiencing a
dermatologic event and subsequently resulting in premature withdrawal from the study.
This further hindered the study’s ability to demonstrate efficacy.
A statistically significant dose response was not seen for both of the primary efficacy
endpoints, change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and CIBIC+ at Week 24,
and for the secondary efficacy endpoint, mean NPI-X values from Week 4 to Week 24.
Adjusted means for all 3 endpoints were similar across all treatment groups.
There were an increased number of dermatologic adverse events reported in the active
treatment groups as compared to the placebo group. There were 3 serious adverse events.
In addition, there were 3 deaths that were deemed unrelated to treatment.
For the laboratory data, subjects in both the xanomeline low and high dose groups
showed more observations above normal range than the placebo group. Albumin was
more often lower than the normal range for subjects in the placebo and xanomeline low
dose group. Subjects in the xanomeline treatment groups had statistically significantly
more values above the normal range than subjects in the placebo group for both urea
nitrogen and eosinophils. There was a statistically significant association between
clinically significant changes from the previous visit and treatment group for aspartate
aminotransferase and eosinophils. Shifts from baseline for eosinophils were statistically
significant with both xanomeline treatment groups showing more changes from normal to
above normal than the placebo group. There was no significant association with
treatment group in the Hy’s law analysis examining shifts in liver function tests between
baseline values and values while on treatment.
There were only minor changes from baseline in vital signs and weight at Week 24.

Note: Treatment emergent events are defined as events which start on or after the start of treatment.
Note: Adverse events are coded using MedDRA.
Note: Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the safety population within each treatment
group.
Note: P-values are based on Fisher's Exact test for the comparison of placebo versus each active treatment
group. An asterisk is appended to p-values that are less than 0.15.
Note: The column [AE] represents the total number of times an event was recorded.

Safety and Efficacy of the Xanomeline
Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) in Patients
with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease
1. Introduction
The M1 muscarinic-cholinergic receptor is 1 of 5 characterized muscarinic-cholinergic
receptor subtypes (Fisher and Barak 1994). M1 receptors in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus are, for the most part, preserved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), while the
presynaptic neurons projecting to these receptors from the nucleus basalis of Meynert
degenerate (Bierer et al. 1995). The presynaptic loss of cholinergic neurons has been
correlated to the antimortum cognitive impairment in AD patients, prompting speculation
that replacement therapy with cholinomimetics will alleviate the cognitive dysfunction of
the disorder (Fisher and Barak 1994).
Xanomeline is a novel M1 agonist which has shown high affinity for the M1 receptor
subtype (in transfected cells), and substantially less or no affinity for other muscarinic
subtypes. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of 11C-labeled xanomeline in
cynomolgus monkeys have suggested that the compound crosses the blood-brain barrier
and preferentially binds the striatum and neocortex.
Clinical development of an oral formulation of xanomeline for the indication of mild and
moderate AD was initiated approximately 4 years ago. A large-scale study of safety and
efficacy provided evidence that an oral dosing regimen of 75 mg three times daily (TID)
may be associated with enhanced cognition and improved clinical global impression,
relative to placebo. As well, a dramatic reduction in psychosis, agitation, and other
problematic behaviors, which often complicate the course of the disease, was
documented. However, the discontinuation rate associated with this oral dosing regimen
was 58.6%, and alternative clinical strategies have been sought to improve tolerance for
the compound.
To that end, development of a Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) has been initiated.
Relative to the oral formulation, the transdermal formulation eliminates high
concentrations of xanomeline in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and presystemic (firstpass) metabolism. Three transdermal delivery systems, hereafter referred to as the
xanomeline TTS Formulation A, xanomeline TTS Formulation B, and xanomeline TTS
formulation E have been manufactured by Lohman Therapy Systems GmbH of
Andernach Germany. TTS Formulation A is 27 mg xanomeline freebase in a 25-cm2
matrix. TTS Formulation B is 57.6 mg xanomeline freebase in a 40-cm2 matrix.
Formulation E has been produced in 2 patch sizes: 1) 54 mg xanomeline freebase with
0.06 mg Vitamin E USP in a 50-cm2 matrix and 2) 27 mg xanomeline freebase with 0.03
mg Vitamin E USP in a 25-cm2 matrix. For a detailed description of the composition of

2. Objectives
2.1. Primary Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are
x

To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall
Type 1 error rate, D=.05) between the change in both ADAS-Cog (see
Attachment LZZT.2) and CIBIC+ (see Attachment LZZT.3) scores, and
drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]).

x

To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.

2.2. Secondary Objectives
The secondary objectives of this study are
x

To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores
on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate
improvement in these areas (see Attachment LZZT.4).

x

To assess the dose-dependent improvements in activities of daily living.
Improved scores on the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) will
indicate improvement in these areas (see Attachment LZZT.5).

x

To assess the dose-dependent improvements in an extended assessment of
cognition that integrates attention/concentration tasks. The Alzheimer’s
Disease Assessment Scale-14 item Cognitive Subscale, hereafter referred
to as ADAS-Cog (14), will be used for this assessment (see Attachment
LZZT.2).

x

To assess the treatment response as a function of Apo E genotype.

3. Investigational Plan
3.1. Summary of Study Design
Patients with probable mild to moderate AD will be studied in a randomized, doubleblind, parallel (3 arm), placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks duration. The study will be
conducted on an outpatient basis. Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled (see
Schedule of Events for Protocol H2Q-MC-LZZT(c), Attachment LZZT.1).
Following informed consent, patients will be screened at Visit 1. At screening, patients
will undergo complete neuropsychiatric assessment, psychometric testing, and general
medical assessment (including medical history, pre-existing conditions, physical
examination). In addition, vital signs, temperature, medication history,
electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and safety laboratories will be obtained. During
the screening visit, patients will wear a placebo TTS to determine willingness and ability
to comply with transdermal administration procedures. If patients have not had central
nervous system (CNS) imaging in the previous 12 months, a computed tomography (CT)
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be obtained. If patients are insulin
dependent diabetics, a hemoglobin A1c will be obtained. Screening exams and
procedures may be performed after Visit 1; however, their results must be completed and
available prior to randomization. The screening process should occur within 2 weeks of
randomization (Visit 3 of the study).
Patients who meet enrollment criteria from Visit 1 will proceed to Visit 2 at which time
they will undergo a 24-hour Ambulatory ECG. At Visit 3 the Ambulatory ECG will be
removed and patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. The treatment arms
will include a placebo arm, a low-dose xanomeline arm (50 cm2 TTS Formulation E, 54
mg xanomeline), and a high-dose xanomeline arm (75 cm2 TTS Formulation E, 81 mg
xanomeline). All patients receiving xanomeline will be started at 50 cm2 TTS
Formulation E. For the first 8 weeks of treatment, patients will be assessed at clinic visits
every 2 weeks and, thereafter, at clinic visits every 4 weeks. Patients who discontinue
prior to Visit 12 (Week 24) will be brought back for full efficacy assessments at or near
to 24 weeks, whenever possible.
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), chaired by an external cardiologist, will meet
after 75, 150, 225, and 300 patients have completed 1 month of treatment. The DSMB
will review cardiovascular findings to decide if discontinuation of the study or any
treatment arm is appropriate, if additional cardiovascular monitoring is required, if
further cardiovascular monitoring is unnecessary, or if adjustment of dose within a
treatment arm (or arms) is appropriate (see Section 3.9.4).
At Visits 3, 8, 10, and 12, efficacy instruments (ADAS-Cog, CIBIC+, and DAD) will be
administered. NPI-X will be administered at 2-week intervals either at clinic visits or via
a telephone interview. Vital signs, temperature, and an assessment of adverse events will
Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)

Document Page 8

be obtained at all clinic visits. An electrocardiogram (ECG), and chemistry/hematology
safety labs will be obtained at Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Urinalysis will be
done at Visits 4, 9, and 12. Use of concomitant medications will be collected at Visits 3,
4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Plasma levels of xanomeline and metabolites will be
obtained at Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11. At Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12,
medications will be dispensed to the patients.
Visits 1 through 13 should be scheduled relative to Visit 3 (Week 0 - randomization).
Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, and 13 should occur within 3 days of their scheduled date. Visits 9, 10,
11, and 12 should occur within 4 days of their scheduled date. At Visit 13 patients will
be given the option to enter the open-label extension phase (see Section 3.10.3. Study
Extensions).

3.2. Discussion of Design and Control
Previous studies of the oral formulation have shown that xanomeline tartrate may
improve behavior and cognition. Effects on behavior are manifest within 2 to 4 weeks of
initiation of treatment. The same studies have shown that 8 to 12 weeks are required to
demonstrate effects on cognition and clinical global assessment. This study is intended
to determine the acute and chronic effects of the TTS formulation in AD; for that reason,
the study is of 26 weeks duration. Dosage specification has been made on the basis of
tolerance to the xanomeline TTS in a clinical pharmacology study (H2Q-EW-LKAA),
and target plasma levels as determined in studies of the oral formulation of xanomeline
(H2Q-MC-LZZA).
The parallel dosing regimen maximizes the ability to make direct comparisons between
the treatment groups. The use of placebo allows for a blinded, thus minimally biased,
study. The placebo treatment group is a comparator group for efficacy and safety
assessment.

Two interim analyses are planned for this study. The first interim analysis will occur
when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 8 (8 weeks). If required, the second
interim analysis will occur when 50% of the patients have completed Visit 12 (24
weeks). (See Section 4.6, Interim Analyses.)

An Ethical Review Board (ERB) approved informed consent will be signed by the patient
(and/or legal representative) and caregiver after the nature of the study is explained.

3.4.2. Criteria for Enrollment
For Lilly studies, the following definitions are used:
Screen

Screening is the act of determining if an individual meets minimum
requirements to become part of a pool of potential candidates for
participation in a clinical study.
In this study, screening will include asking the candidate preliminary
questions (such as age and general health status) and conducting invasive
or diagnostic procedures and/or tests (for example, diagnostic
psychological tests, x-rays, blood draws). Patients will sign the consent at

Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Document Page 10

their screening visit, thereby consenting to undergo the screening
procedures and to participate in the study if they qualify.
To enter

Patients entered into the study are those from whom informed consent for
the study has been obtained. Adverse events will be reported for each
patient who has entered the study, even if the patient is never assigned to
a treatment group (enrolled).

To enroll

Patients who are enrolled in the study are those who have been assigned
to a treatment group. Patients who are entered into the study but fail to
meet criteria specified in the protocol for treatment assignment will not be
enrolled in the study.

At Visit 1, patients who meet the enrollment criteria of Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) score of 10 to 23 (Attachment LZZT.6), Hachinski Ischemia Score d4
(Attachment LZZT.8), a physical exam, safety labs, ECG, and urinalysis, will proceed to
Visit 2 and Visit 3. At Visit 3, patients whose CNS imaging and other pending labs from
Visit 1 satisfy the inclusion criteria (Section 3.4.2.1) will be enrolled in the study.
Approximately 300 patients with a diagnosis of probable mild to moderate AD will be
enrolled in the study.
3.4.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
Patients may be included in the study only if they meet all the following criteria:
[1] Males and postmenopausal females at least 50 years of age.
[2] Diagnosis of probable AD as defined by National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS)
and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association
(ADRDA) guidelines (Attachment LZZT.7).
[3] MMSE score of 10 to 23.
[4] Hachinski Ischemic Scale score of d4 (Attachment LZZT.8).
[5] CNS imaging (CT scan or MRI of brain) compatible with AD within
past 1 year.

The following findings are incompatible with AD:
a) Large vessel strokes
1) Any definite area of encephalomalacia consistent with ischemic
necrosis in any cerebral artery territory.
2) Large, confluent areas of encephalomalacia in parieto-occipital
or frontal regions consistent with watershed infarcts.
The above are exclusionary. Exceptions are made for small areas of
cortical asymmetry which may represent a small cortical stroke or a
focal area of atrophy provided there is no abnormal signal intensity
in the immediately underlying parenchyma. Only one such
questionable area allowed per scan, and size is restricted to d1cm in
frontal/parietal/temporal cortices and d2 cm in occipital cortex.
b) Small vessel ischemia
1) Lacunar infarct is defined as an area of abnormal intensity seen
on CT scan or on both T1 and T2 weighted MRI images in the
basal ganglia, thalamus or deep white matter which is d1 cm in
maximal diameter. A maximum of one lacune is allowed per
scan.
2) Leukoariosis or leukoencephalopathy is regarded as an
abnormality seen on T2 but not T1 weighted MRIs, or on CT.
This is accepted if mild or moderate in extent, meaning
involvement of less than 25% of cortical white matter.
c) Miscellaneous
1) Benign small extra-axial tumors (ie, meningiomas) are accepted
if they do not contact or indent the brain parenchyma.
2) Small extra-axial arachnoid cysts are accepted if they do not
indent or deform the brain parenchyma.
[6] Investigator has obtained informed consent signed by the patient
(and/or legal representative) and by the caregiver.
[7] Geographic proximity to investigator’s site that allows adequate
follow-up.
[8] A reliable caregiver who is in frequent or daily contact with the patient
and who will accompany the patient to the office and/or be available
by telephone at designated times, will monitor administration of
prescribed medications, and will be responsible for the overall care of
the patient at home. The caregiver and the patient must be able to
communicate in English and willing to comply with 26 weeks of
transdermal therapy.

allowed to enroll with results of 23 to 51% provided the
remainder of the thyroid profile is normal and there are no
clinical signs or symptoms of thyroid abnormality.
ii) TSH reference range 0.32 to 5.0. Patients will be allowed to enroll
with results of 0.03 to 6.2 if patients are taking stable doses of
exogenous thyroid supplements, with normal free thyroid index,
and show no clinical signs or symptoms of thyroid abnormality.
iii) Total T4 reference range 4.5 to 12.5. Patients will be allowed to
enroll with results of 4.1 to 13.4 if patients are taking stable
doses of exogenous thyroid hormone, with normal free thyroid
index, and show no clinical signs or symptoms of thyroid
abnormality.
iv) Free Thyroid Index reference range 1.1 to 4.6.
[29b] Positive syphilis screening.
Positive syphilis screening. As determined by positive RPR followed
up by confirmatory FTA-Abs. Confirmed patients are excluded unless
there is a documented medical history of an alternative disease (for
example, yaws) which caused the lab abnormality.
[30b] Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). Required only on patients with
known diabetes mellitus or random blood sugar >200 on screening
labs. Patients will be excluded if levels are >9.5%

3.4.2.3. Violation of Criteria for Enrollment
The criteria for enrollment must be followed explicitly. If there is inadvertent enrollment
of individuals who do not meet enrollment criteria, these individuals should be
discontinued from the study. Such individuals can remain in the study only if there are
ethical reasons to have them continue. In these cases, the investigator must obtain
approval from the Lilly research physician for the study participant to continue in the
study (even if the study is being conducted through a contract research organization).

3.4.3. Disease Diagnostic Criteria
Probable AD will be defined clinically by NINCDS/ADRDA guidelines as follows:
x

Diagnosis of probable AD as defined by National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS)
and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association
(ADRDA) guidelines.

x

Mild to moderate severity of AD will be defined by the Mini-Mental
State Exam as follows:
x

x

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 10 to 23.

The absence of other causes of dementia will be performed by clinical
opinion and by the following:
x

Hachinski Ischemic Scale score of d4.

Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Copyright  2006 Eli Lilly and Company
Document Page 23

x

CNS imaging (CT scan or MRI of brain) compatible with AD
within past 1 year (see Section 3.4.2.1).

3.4.4. Sample Size
Approximately 100 patients will be randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups.
Previous experience with the oral formulation of xanomeline suggests that this sample
size has 90% power to detect a 3.0 mean treatment difference in ADAS-Cog (p<.05, twosided), based on a standard deviation of 6.5. Furthermore, this sample size has 80%
power to detect a 0.36 mean treatment difference in CIBIC+ (p<.05, two-sided), based on
a standard deviation of 0.9.

3.5. Patient Assignment
Commencing at Visit 1, all patients will be assigned an identification number. This
identification number and the patient’s three initials must appear on all patient-related
documents submitted to Lilly.
When qualified for enrollment at Visit 3 the patient will be randomized to 1 of 3
treatment arms.

3.6. Dosage and Administration
3.6.1. Materials and Supplies
Primary Study Material:

Xanomeline

TTS (adhesive patches)

50 cm2, 54 mg*
25 cm2, 27 mg*

Comparator Material:

Placebo

TTS

Identical in appearance to primary
study material

*All doses are measured in terms of the xanomeline base.

Patches should be stored at controlled room temperature, and all used patches must be
handled and disposed of as biohazardous waste.
For a detailed description of the composition of these formulations please refer to Part II,
Section 14 of the Xanomeline (LY246708) Clinical Investigator’s Brochure.

3.6.2. TTS Administration Procedures
To test acute tolerance of transdermal formulation, patients will have a TTS (placebo)
administered at the start of Visit 1, and removed at the conclusion of Visit 1. The
patient’s and caregiver’s willingness to comply with 26 weeks of transdermal therapy
should be elicited, and those patients/caregivers unwilling to comply should be excluded.

Document Page 24

Upon enrollment at Visit 3, and on the morning of each subsequent day of therapy ,
xanomeline or placebo will be administered with the application of 2 adhesive patches,
one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25 cm2 in area. Each morning, prior to the application of the
patches, hydrocortisone cream (1%) should be applied to the skin at the intended site of
administration, rubbed in, and allowed to penetrate for approximately 30 minutes.
Thereafter, excess cream should be wiped away and the patches applied.
The patches are to be worn continuously throughout the day, for a period of
approximately 12 to 14 hours, and removed in the evening. After removal of the patches,
hydrocortisone cream (1%) should be applied locally to the site of administration.
Patches should be applied to a dry, intact, non-hairy area. Applying the patch to a shaved
area is not recommended. The application site of the patches should be rotated according
to the following schedule:
Day
Sunday
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday

Patch Location
right or left upper arm
right or left upper back
right or left lower back (above belt line)
right or left buttocks
right or left mid-axillary region
right or left upper thigh
right or left upper chest

Patients and caregivers are free to select either the left or right site within the constraints
of the rotation schedule noted above. Patches should be applied at approximately the
same time each day. For patients who habitually bathe in the morning, the patient should
bathe prior to application of new patches. Every effort should be taken to allow for
morning administration of the patches. Exceptions allowing administration of TTS
patches at night instead of in the morning will be made on a case-by-case basis by the
CRO medical monitor. In the event that some adhesive remains on the patient’s skin and
cannot be removed with normal bathing, a special solution will be provided to remove the
adhesive.
Following randomization at Visit 3, patients will be instructed to call the site if they have
difficulty with application or wearing of patches. In the event that a patch becomes
detached, a new patch of the same size should be applied (at earliest convenience) to an
area of the dermis adjacent to the detachment site, and the rotation schedule should be
resumed the following morning. If needed, the edges of the patch may be secured with a
special adhesive tape that will be provided. If daily doses are reduced, improperly
administered, or if a patch becomes detached and requires application of a new patch on
three or more days in any 30-day period, the CRO research physician will be notified.

Document Page 25

If the daily dose is reduced or improperly administered in the 24 hours prior to any
scheduled clinic visit, the visit should be rescheduled (except for early termination and
retrieval visits).
Patients must be instructed to return all used and unused study drug to the investigator at
each visit for proper disposal and CT reconciliation by the investigator.

3.7. Blinding
The study will be double-blind. To further preserve the blinding of the study, only a
minimum number of Lilly and CRO personnel will see the randomization table and codes
before the study is complete.
Emergency codes generated by a computer drug-labeling system will be available to the
investigator. These codes, which reveal the patients treatment group, may be opened
during the study only if the choice of follow-up treatment depends on the patient’s
therapy assignment.
The investigator should make every effort to contact the clinical research physician prior
to unblinding a patient’s therapy assignment. If a patient’s therapy assignment is
unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately by telephone. After the study, the
investigator must return all sealed and any opened codes.

3.8. Concomitant Therapy
Intermittent use of chloral hydrate, zolpidem, or lorazepam is permitted during this
clinical trial as indicated for agitation or sleep. If medication is required for agitation for
a period exceeding 1 week, a review of the patient’s status should be made in
consultation with the CRO research physician. Caregivers and patients should be
reminded that these medications should not be taken within 24 hours of a clinic visit
(including the enrollment visit), and administration of efficacy measures should be
deferred if the patient has been treated with these medications within the previous 24
hours.
If an antihistamine is required during the study, Claritin (loratadine) or Allegra
(fexofenadine hydrochloride) are the preferred agents, but should not be taken within 24
hours of a clinic visit. Intermittent use (per package insert) of antitussives (containing
antihistamines or codeine) and select narcotic analgesics (acetaminophen with
oxycodone, acetaminophen with codeine) are permitted during the trial. Caregivers and
patients should be reminded that antihistamines and narcotics should not be taken within
3 days of a clinic efficacy visit (including enrollment visit). If an H2 blocker is required
during the study, Axid (nizatidine) will be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the
CRO medical monitor. For prostatic hypertrophy, small doses (2 mg per day) of Hytrin
(terazosin) or Cardura (doxazosin) will be permitted on a case-by-case basis. Please
consult the medical monitor. The calcium channel blockers Cardene (nicardipine),

Norvasc (amlodipine), and DynaCirc (isradipine) are allowed during the study. If a
patient has been treated with any medication within disallowed time periods prior to the
clinic visit, efficacy measures should be deferred.
Other classes of medications not stated in Exclusion Criteria, Section 3.4.2.2, will be
permitted. Patients who require treatment with an excluded medication (Section 3.4.2.2)
will be discontinued from the study following consultation with the CRO research
physician.

3.9. Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, and Safety Evaluations
3.9.1. Efficacy
See Schedule of Events, Attachment LZZT.1 for the times of the study at which efficacy
data will be collected.
3.9.1.1. Efficacy Measures
The following measures will be performed in the course of the study. At Visits 3, 8, 10,
and 12, ADAS-Cog, CIBIC+, and DAD will be administered. NPI-X will be
administered at 2-week intervals either at clinic visits or via a telephone interview.
Efficacy measures will also be collected at early termination visits, and at the retrieval
visit. The neuropsychological assessment should be performed first; other protocol
requirements, such as labs and the physical, should follow.
a)

Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale
(ADAS-Cog): ADAS-Cog is an established measure of cognitive
function in Alzheimer’s Disease. This scale has been incorporated into
this study by permission of Dr. Richard C. Mohs and the American
Journal of Psychiatry and was adapted from an article entitled, “The
Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS),” which was
published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Volume No.141,
pages 1356-1364, November, 1984, Copyright 1984.

Document Page 27

The ADAS-Cog (11) and the ADAS-Cog (14): The ADAS-Cog (11)
is a standard 11-item instrument used to assess word recall, naming
objects, commands, constructional praxis, ideational praxis,
orientation, word recognition tasks, spoken language ability,
comprehension, word finding difficulty, and recall of test instructions.
For the purposes of this study, three items (delayed word recall,
attention/visual search task, and maze solution) have been added to the
ADAS-Cog (11) to assess the patient’s attention and concentration.
The 14 item instrument will be referred to as the ADAS-Cog (14). At
each efficacy visit, all 14 items will be assessed, and in subsequent
data analyses, performance on the ADAS-Cog (14) and performance
on the subset ADAS-Cog (11) will be considered.
b) Video-referenced Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of
Change (CIBIC+): The CIBIC+ is an assessment of the global
clinical status relative to baseline. The CIBIC+ used in this study is
derived from the Clinical Global Impression of Change, an instrument
in the public domain, developed by the National Institute on Aging
Alzheimer’s Disease Study Units Program (1 U01 AG10483; Leon
Thal, Principal Investigator). The instrument employs semi-structured
interviews with the patient and caregiver, to assess mental/cognitive
state, behavior, and function. These domains are not individually
scored, but rather are aggregated in the assignment of a global numeric
score on a 1 to 7 scale (1 = marked improvement; 4 = no change; and 7
= marked worsening).
The clinician assessing CIBIC+ will have at least one year of
experience with the instrument and will remain blinded to all other
efficacy and safety measures.
c) Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X): The NPI-X is an
assessment of change in psychopathology in patients with dementia.
The NPI-X is administered to the designated caregiver. This
instrument has been revised from its original version (Cummings et al.
1994) and incorporated into this study with the permission of Dr.
Jeffrey L. Cummings.
d) Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD): The DAD is used to
assess functional abilities of activities of daily living (ADL) in
individuals with cognitive impairment. This scale has been revised and
incorporated into this study by permission of Louise Gauthier, M.Sc.,
and Dr. Isabelle Gelinas. The DAD is administered to the designated
caregiver.
For each instrument, each assessment is to be performed by the same trained health care
professional. If circumstances preclude meeting this requirement, the situation is to be
documented on the Clinical Report Form (CRF), and the CRO research physician is to be
notified.

In addition to the efficacy measures noted above, a survey form will be used to collect
information from the caregiver on TTS acceptability (Attachment LZZT.9).
3.9.1.2. Efficacy Criteria
Group mean changes from baseline in the primary efficacy parameters will serve as
efficacy criteria. The ADAS-Cog (11) and the video-referenced CIBIC+ will serve as the
primary efficacy instruments. Secondary efficacy instruments will include the DAD, the
NPI-X, and the ADAS-Cog (14). The procedures and types of analyses to be done are
outlined in Section 4.
The primary analysis of efficacy will include only the data obtained up to and including
the visit of discontinuation of study drug. Furthermore, the primary analysis will not
include efficacy data obtained at any visit where the study drug was not administered in
the preceding three days. Analyses that include the retrieved dropouts are considered
secondary.

3.9.2. Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples (7 mL) for the determination of xanomeline concentrations in plasma will
be collected from each patient at Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11. The blood sample drawn at
Visit 3 is a baseline sample. The remaining 5 clinic visits should be scheduled so that 1
blood sample is collected at any time during each of the following intervals: early AM
visit (hold application of new patch until after blood sample is collected); 9AM to 11AM;
11AM to 1PM; 1PM to 3PM; and 3PM to 5PM. Collection of blood samples during each
of these intervals should not occur in any particular order, nor should they occur in the
same order for each patient. Every effort should be made to comply with the suggested
sampling times. This blood-sampling schedule is based on a sparse sampling strategy
where only a few samples will be collected from each patient. The most crucial aspect of
the sampling design is to record the date and exact time the sample was drawn and to
record the date and time of patch application on the day of the clinic visit and the
previous 2 days.
If a patient is discontinued from the study prior to protocol completion, a
pharmacokinetic blood sample should be drawn at the early discontinuation visit. The
date and exact time the sample was drawn and the date of the last patch application
should be recorded.
Immediately after collection, each sample will be centrifuged at approximately 177 u G
for 15 minutes. The plasma will be transferred into a polypropylene tube bearing the
identical label as the blood collection tube. Samples will be capped and frozen at
approximately 20°C. Care must be taken to insure that the samples remain frozen
during transit.
The samples will be shipped on dry ice to Central Laboratory.

3.9.3. Safety
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this
study and for alerting CRO to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be
considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient. See Section 3.9.3.2.1.
Investigators must ensure that appropriate medical care is maintained throughout the
study and after the trial (for example, to follow adverse events).
3.9.3.1. Safety Measures
Safety measures will be performed at designated times by recording adverse events,
laboratory test results, vital signs (including supine/standing pulse and blood pressure
readings) ECG monitoring, and Ambulatory ECGs (see Schedule of Events, Attachment
LZZT.1).
3.9.3.2. Clinical Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting adverse events that are to be followed, regardless of
applicable regulatory requirements that are less stringent. For purposes of collecting and
evaluating all information about Lilly drugs used in clinical trials, an adverse event is
defined as any undesirable experience or an unanticipated benefit (see Section 3.9.3.2.1)
that occurs after informed consent for the study has been obtained, without regard to
treatment group assignment, even if no study medication has been taken. Lack of drug
effect is not an adverse event in clinical trials, because the purpose of the clinical trial is
to establish drug effect.
At the first visit, study site personnel will question the patient and will note the
occurrence and nature of presenting condition(s) and of any preexisting condition(s). At
subsequent visits, site personnel will again question the patient and will note any change
in the presenting condition(s), any change in the preexisting condition(s), and/or the
occurrence and nature of any adverse events.
3.9.3.2.1. Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All adverse events must be reported to CRO via case report form.
Study site personnel must report to CRO immediately, by telephone, any serious adverse
event (see Section 3.9.3.2.2 below), or if the investigator unblinds a patient’s treatment
group assignment because of an adverse event or for any other reason.
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or if a patient is discontinued from the study because of
any significant laboratory abnormality, inadequate response to treatment, or any other
reason, the circumstances and data leading to any such dosage reduction or
discontinuation must be reported and clearly documented by study site personnel on the
clinical report form.

Document Page 30

An event that may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient (for example,
sleeping longer) should be reported to CRO as an adverse event on the clinical report
form. “Unanticipated benefit” is a COSTART classification term. In cases where the
investigator notices an unanticipated benefit to the patient, study site personnel should
enter the actual term such as “sleeping longer,” and code “unanticipated benefit” in the
clinical report form adverse event section.
Solicited adverse events from the skin rash questionnaire (see Section 3.9.3.4) should be
reported on the questionnaire only and not also on the adverse event clinical report form
3.9.3.2.2. Serious Adverse Events
Study site personnel must report to CRO immediately, by telephone, any adverse event
from this study that is alarming or that:
x

Results in death

x

Results in initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization

x

Is life-threatening

x

Results in severe or permanent disability

x

Results in cancer [(other than cancers diagnosed prior to enrollment in
studies involving patients with cancer)]

x

Results in a congenital anomaly

x

Is a drug overdose

x

Is significant for any other reason.

Definition of overdose: For a drug under clinical investigation, an overdose is any
intentional or unintentional consumption of the drug (by any route) that exceeds the dose
recommended in the Clinical Investigator's Brochure or in an investigational protocol,
whichever dose is larger. For a marketed drug, a drug overdose is any intentional or
unintentional consumption of the drug (by any route) that exceeds the dose listed in
product labeling, even if the larger dose is prescribed by a physician.
3.9.3.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests
Table LZZT.1 lists the clinical laboratory tests that will be performed at Visit 1.

investigator by marking CS (for clinically significant) or NCS (for not clinically
significant) next to the values. Any clinically significant laboratory values that are
outside a clinically acceptable range or differ importantly from a previous value should
be further commented on in the clinical report form comments page.
Hematology, and clinical chemistry will also be performed at Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, and 13. Patients that experience a rash and/or eosinophilia may have additional
hematology samples obtained as described in 3.9.3.4 (Other Safety Measures).

Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Document Page 32

Urinalysis will also be performed at Visits 4, 9, and 12. The following criteria have been
developed to monitor hepatic function.
x

Patients with ALT/SGPT levels >120 IU will be retested weekly.

x

Patients with ALT/SGPT values >400 IU, or alternatively, an elevated
ALT/SGPT accompanied by GGT and/or ALP values >500 IU will be
retested within 2 days. The sponsor’s clinical research administrator or
clinical research physician is to be notified. If the retest value does not
decrease by at least 10%, the study drug will be discontinued; additional
laboratory tests will be performed until levels return to normal. If the
retest value does decrease by 10% or more, the study drug may be
continued with monitoring at 3 day intervals until ALT/SGPT values
decrease to <400 IU or GGT and/or ALP values decrease to <500 IU.

3.9.3.4. Other Safety Measures
Patients experiencing Rash and/or Eosinophilia
The administration of placebo and xanomeline TTS is associated with a rash and/or
eosinophilia in some patients. The rash is characterized in the following ways:
x

The rash is confined to sites of application.

x

The rash may be associated with pruritus.

x

In 5% of cases of rash observed in the Interim Analysis, blistering has
been observed.

x

The onset of rash may occur at any time during the course of the study.

x

A moderate eosinophilia (0.6-1.5 x 103/microliter) is associated with rash
and has been noted in approximately 10% of patients.

It does not appear that the rash constitutes a significant safety risk; however, it could
affect the well-being of the patients. The following monitoring is specified:
Skin Rash Follow-up
For patients who exit the study or its extension with rash at the site(s) of application:
a) Approximately 2 weeks after the last visit, the study site personnel
should contact the patient/caregiver by phone and complete the skin
rash questionnaire. (Note: those patients with rash who have
previously exited the study or its extension should be contacted at
earliest convenience.)
b) If caregiver states unequivocally that skin problems have completely
resolved, no further follow-up is needed.

Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Document Page 33

c) If caregiver reports scarring and/or other problems, patient should
return to clinic for a follow-up visit. The skin rash questionnaire
should again be completed. If in the opinion of the investigator,
further follow-up is required, contact the CRO medical monitor.
Completed skin rash questionnaires should be faxed to CRO.
Completion of the questionnaires will create a separate data set for solicited adverse
events. In completing these forms please note the following:
1. Solicited events (events discovered as result of completion of follow-up
questionnaires) should be reported on questionnaire page only.
2. Spontaneously reported adverse events (events presented by the patient
without direct questioning of the event) should be reported as described in
3.9.3.2.1 (Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).
Serious adverse events should be handled and reported as described in 3.9.3.2.1 without
regard to whether the event is solicited or spontaneously reported.
Eosinophilia Follow-up
1. For patients that are currently in the study with eosinophil counts greater than
0.6x103/microliter:
x

Repeat hematology at each visit until resolved in the opinion of the
investigator.

2. For patients that are currently in the study with eosinophil counts greater than
1.5x103/microliter:
x

Obtain hematology profile every 2 weeks until resolved or explained
by other causes in the opinion of the investigator.

x

Notify CRO medical monitor.

3. For patients with eosinophil counts greater than 0.6x103/microliter at exit
from the study or its extension:
x

Obtain hematology profile approximately every 2 weeks until resolved
or, in the opinion of the investigator, explained by other causes. (Note:
patients with eosinophil counts greater than 0.6x103/microliter who
have previously exited the study or its extension should return for
hematology profile at earliest convenience.)

3.9.3.4.1 Vital Sign Determination
Patient should lie supine quietly for at least 5 minutes prior to vital signs measurement.
Blood pressure should be measured in the dominant arm with a standardized mercury
manometer according to the American Heart Association standard recommendations.
Diastolic blood pressure will be measured as the point of disappearance of the Korotkoff
Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Document Page 34

sounds (phase V). Heart rate will be measured by auscultation. Patient should then stand
up. Blood pressure should again be measured in the dominant arm and heart rate should
be measured after approximately 1 and 3 minutes.
An automated blood pressure cuff may be used in place of a mercury manometer if it is
regularly (at least monthly) standardized against a mercury manometer.
3.9.3.4.2.Cardiovascular Safety Measures
Cardiovascular status will be assessed during the trial with the following measures:
x

All patients will be screened by obtaining a 12-lead ECG, and will have
repeat ECGs performed at Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and early
termination (ET) (see Schedule of Events, Attachment LZZT.1).

x

All patients will undergo a 24-hour Ambulatory ECG at Visit 2 (prior to
the initiation of study medication). Although every effort will be made to
obtain the entire 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording, this may not always
be feasible because of patient behavior or technical difficulties. The
minimal recording period for an ambulatory ECG to be considered
interpretable will be 8 hours, of which at least 3 hours must be sleep.

x

The incidence of syncope, defined as an observed loss of consciousness
and muscle tone not attributable to transient ischemic attack or to seizure,
will be closely monitored. Caregivers will be instructed to report any
instance of syncopal episodes to the investigator within 24 hours. The
investigator should immediately report such events to the CRO research
physician. The CRO research physician will make a clinical assessment
of each episode, and with the investigator determine if continuation of
therapy is appropriate. These findings will be reported to the Lilly
research physician immediately.

3.9.4. Safety Monitoring
The CRO research physician will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study.
Cardiovascular measures, including ECGs and 24-hour Ambulatory ECGs (see Section
3.9.3.4.2) will be monitored on an ongoing basis as follows:

Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Copyright  2006 Eli Lilly and Company
Document Page 35

x

As noted in Section 3.9.3.4.2, all patients will be screened by obtaining a
12-lead ECG, and will have repeat ECGs performed at Visits 4, 5, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, and early termination (ET) (see Schedule of Events for
Protocol H2Q-MC-LZZT(c), Attachment LZZT.1). ECG data will be
interpreted at the site and express mailed overnight to a central facility
which will produce a report within 48 hours. The report will be forwarded
to the investigator. At screening, the report of the central facility will be
used to exclude patients according to criteria specified in Section 3.4.2.2.
If, during the treatment phase of the study, review of ECG data (either at
the site or at the central facility) reveals left bundle branch block,
bradycardia d50 beats per minute, sinus pauses >2 seconds, second degree
heart block, third degree heart block, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,
sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, or ventricular tachycardia at a
rate of t120 beats per minute lasting t10 seconds, the investigator, the
Lilly research physician, the CRO research physician, and the cardiologist
chairing the DSMB will be notified immediately, and discontinuation of
the patient will be considered.

x

As noted in Section 3.9.3.4.2, all patients will undergo a 24-hour
Ambulatory ECG at Visit 2 (prior to the initiation of study medication).
Ambulatory ECG data from Visit 2 will be express mailed overnight to a
central facility which will produce a report within 24 hours. The report
will be forwarded to the investigator. If a report documents sustained
ventricular tachycardia with rate !120 beats per minute, third degree heart
block, or sinus pauses of !6.0 seconds, the investigator, the Lilly research
physician, the CRO research physician, and the cardiologist chairing the
DSMB will be notified immediately, and the patient will be discontinued.
If any report documents sinus pauses of !3.0 seconds or second degree
heart block, the CRO research physician, and Lilly research physician, and
cardiologist chairing the DSMB will be immediately notified and the
record will be reviewed within 24 hours of notification by the cardiologist
chairing the DSMB.

In addition to ongoing monitoring of cardiac measures, a comprehensive, periodic review
of cardiovascular safety data will be conducted by the DSMB, which will be chaired by
an external cardiologist with expertise in arrhythmias, their pharmacological bases, and
their clinical implications. The membership of the board will also include two other
external cardiologists, a cardiologist from Lilly, a statistician from Lilly, and the Lilly
research physician. Only the three external cardiologists will be voting members.
After approximately 75 patients have completed 1 month of treatment, the DSMB will
meet to decide:
x

If discontinuation of the study or any treatment arm is appropriate

x

If additional cardiovascular monitoring is required

x

If further cardiovascular monitoring is unnecessary

x

If adjustment of dose within a treatment arm (or arms) is appropriate.

If necessary, this analysis will be repeated after 150 patients have completed 1 month of
treatment, after 225 patients have completed 1 month of treatment, and after 300 patients
have completed 1 month of treatment. Primary consideration will be given to the
frequency of pauses documented in Ambulatory ECG reports. The number of pauses
greater than or equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 seconds will be tabulated. Primary analysis will
focus on the number of pauses greater than or equal to 3 seconds.
In the event of a high incidence of patient discontinuation due to syncope, the following
guideline may be employed by the DSMB in determining if discontinuation of any
treatment arm is appropriate. If the frequency of syncope in a xanomeline treatment arm
relative to the frequency of syncope in the placebo arm equals or exceeds the following
numbers, then consideration will be given to discontinuing that treatment arm. The Type
I error rate for this rule is approximately 0.032 if the incidence in each group is 0.04.
The power of this rule is 0.708 if the incidence is 0.04 for placebo and 0.16 for
xanomeline TTS.

This rule has been used in other studies for monitoring spontaneous events with an
incidence of less than 10%. This rule is constructed assuming a 2-group comparison with
each group having a final sample size of 100. Unblinding which occurs during these
analyses will be at the group level and will be documented.
The stopping rule based on Ambulatory ECG findings is as follows:
If the number of patients experiencing a pause of t6 seconds in a xanomeline
treatment arm relative to the number of patients in the placebo arm equals or
exceeds the numbers in the following table, then that treatment arm will be
discontinued. The Type I error rate for this rule is approximately 0.044 if
the incidence in each group is 0.01. The power of this rule is 0.500 if the
incidence is 0.01 for placebo and 0.04 for xanomeline TTS.

3.9.5. Appropriateness and Consistency of Measurements
The medications and efficacy measurements have been used in other studies in elderly
subjects and patients.

3.10. Patient Disposition Criteria
3.10.1. Discontinuations
Participation in the study shall be terminated for any patient who is unable or unwilling
to comply with the study protocol or who develops a serious adverse event.
In addition, patients may be discontinued for any of the following reasons:
x In the opinion of the investigator, a significant adverse event occurs or the
safety of the patient is otherwise compromised.
x The patient requests to be withdrawn from the study.
x The physician in charge of the study or Lilly, for any reason stops the
patient’s participation in the study.
If a patient’s participation terminates early, an early termination visit should be
scheduled. Upon decision to discontinue a patient from the study, the patient’s dose
should be titrated down by instructing the patient to immediately remove the 25-cm2
patch. Patients should be instructed to continue to apply a 50-cm2 patch daily until the
early termination visit, at which time the drug will be discontinued. Physical exam, vital
signs, temperature, use of concomitant medications, chemistry/hematology/urinalysis
labs, xanomeline plasma sample, TTS acceptability survey, efficacy measures, adverse
events, and an ECG will be collected at the early termination visit.
In the event that a patient’s participation or the study itself is terminated, the patient shall
return all study drug(s) to the investigator.

3.10.1.1. Retrieval of Discontinuations
If possible, patients who have terminated early will be retrieved on the date which would
have represented Visit 12 (Week 24). Vital signs, temperature, use of concomitant
medications, adverse events, and efficacy measure assessment will be gathered at this
visit. If the patient is not retrievable, this will be documented in the source record.

3.10.2. Qualifications for Analysis
All patients who are enrolled in the study will be included in the efficacy analysis and the
safety analysis. Patients will not be excluded from the efficacy analysis for reasons such
as non-compliance or ineligibility, except for the time period immediately preceding the
efficacy assessment (see Section 3.9.1.2).

3.10.3. Study Extensions
Patients who successfully complete the study will be eligible for participation in an openlabel extension phase, where every patient will be treated with active agent. The patients
who elect to participate in the open-label extension phase will be titrated to their
maximally titrated dose. This open-label extension phase will continue until the time the
product becomes marketed and is available to the public or until the project is
discontinued by the sponsor. Patients may terminate at any time at their request.
3.10.3.1. Compliance
Because patients enrolled in this study will be outpatients, the knowledge that patients
have taken the medication as prescribed will be assured in the following ways:
a)

Investigators will attempt to select those patients and caregivers who
have been judged to be compliant.

b)

Study medication including unused, partially used, and empty patch
containers will be returned at each clinical visit so that the remaining
medication can be counted by authorized investigator staff (nurse,
pharmacist, or physician). The number of patches remaining will be
recorded on the CRF.

c) Following randomization at Visit 3, patients will be instructed to call
the site if they have difficulty with application or wearing of patches. If
daily doses are reduced, improperly administered, or if a patch becomes
detached and requires application of a new patch on three or more days
in any 30-day period, the CRO research physician will be notified.
If the daily dose is reduced or improperly administered in the 24 hours prior to any
scheduled clinic visit, the visit should be rescheduled (except for early termination and
retrieval visits).

3.11. Quality Assurance
To ensure both the safety of participants in the study, and the collection of accurate,
complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will perform the following
activities:
x

Provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate.

x

Sponsor a start-up training session to instruct the investigators and study
coordinators. This session will give instruction on the protocol, the
completion of the clinical report forms, and study procedures.

x

Make periodic visits to the study site.

x

Be available for consultation and stay in contact with the study site
personnel by mail, telephone, and/or fax.

x

Review and evaluate clinical report form data and use standard computer
edits to detect errors in data collection.

To ensure the safety of participants in the study and to ensure accurate, complete, and
reliable data, the investigator will do the following:
x

Keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and patient medical
records in the patient files as original source documents for the study.

Lilly or its representatives may periodically check a sample of the patient data recorded
against source documents at the study site. The study may be audited by Lilly Medical
Quality Assurance (MQA) and/or regulatory agencies at any time. Investigators will be
given notice before an MQA audit occurs.

4. Data Analysis Methods
4.1. General Considerations
In general, all patients will be included in all analyses of efficacy if they have a baseline
measurement and at least one postrandomization measurement. Refer to Section 3.9.1.2.
for a discussion of which specific efficacy data will be included in the primary analysis.
In the event that the doses of xanomeline TTS are changed after the study starts, the
analysis will be of three treatment groups (high dose, low dose, and placebo), even
though patients within the high dose treatment group, for example, may not all be at
exactly the same dose. Also, if the dose is changed midway through the study, the mean
dose within each group will be used in the dose response analysis described in Section
4.3.3.
All analyses described below will be conducted using the most current production
version of SAS£ available at the time of analysis.

4.2. Demographics and Patient Characteristics Measured at
Baseline
All measures (for example, age, gender, origin) obtained at either Visits 1, 2, or 3, prior
to randomization, will be summarized by treatment group and across all treatment
groups. The groups will be compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous
variables and by Pearson’s chi-square test for categorical variables. Note that because
patients are randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups, any statistically significant
treatment group differences are by definition a Type I error; however, the resulting pvalues will be used as another descriptive statistic to help focus possible additional
analyses (for example, analysis of covariance, subset analyses) on those factors that are
most imbalanced (that is, that have the smallest p-values).

4.3. Efficacy Analyses
4.3.1. Efficacy Variables to be Analyzed
Efficacy measures are described in Section 3.9.1.1. As stated in Section 3.9.1.2, the
primary outcome measures are the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ instruments. Because
both of these variables must reach statistical significance, an adjustment to the nominal
p-values is necessary in order to maintain a .05 Type I error rate for this study. This
adjustment is described in detail in Section 4.3.5.

The DAD will be analyzed with respect to the total score, as well as the subscores of
initiation, planning and organization, and effective performance. This variable is
considered a secondary variable in the US, but is a third primary variable in Europe.
The NPI-X is a secondary variable. The primary assessment of this instrument will be
for the total score, not including the sleep, appetite, and euphoria domains. This total
score is computed by taking the product of the frequency and severity scores and
summing them up across the domains. Secondary variables derived from the NPI-X
include evaluating each domain/behavior separately. Also, caregiver distress from the
NPI-X will be analyzed.
ADAS-Cog (14) and each of the 14 individual components will also be analyzed. In
addition, a subscore of the ADAS-Cog will be computed and analyzed, based on results
from a previous large study of oral xanomeline. This subscore, referred to as ADAS-Cog
(4), will be the sum of constructional praxis, orientation, spoken language ability, and
word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech.
Any computed total score will be treated as missing if more than 30% of the items are
missing or scored “not applicable”. For example, when computing ADAS-Cog(11), if 4
or more items are missing, then the total score will not be computed. When one or more
items are missing (but not more than 30%), the total score will be adjusted in order to
maintain the full range of the scale. For example, ADAS-Cog(11) is a 0-70 scale. If the
first item, Word Recall (ranges from 0 to 10), is missing, then the remaining 10 items of
the ADAS-Cog(11) will be summed and multiplied by (70 / (70-10) ), or 7/6. This
computation will occur for all totals and subtotals of ADAS-Cog and NPI-X. DAD is a
40 item questionnaire where each question is scored as either “0” or “1”. The DAD total
score and component scores are reported as percentage of items that are scored “1”. So if
items of the DAD are “not applicable” or missing, the percentage will be computed for
only those items that are scored. As an example, if two items are missing (leaving 38 that
are scored), and there are 12 items scored as “1”, the rest as “0”, then the DAD score is
12/38=.316.

4.3.2. Times of Analyses
Baseline data will be collected at Visit 3.
The primary analysis of ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ will be the 24-week endpoint,
which is defined for each patient and variable as the last measurement obtained
postrandomization (prior to protocol defined reduction in dose).
Similar analyses at 24 weeks will be conducted for the secondary efficacy variables.
Analysis of patients who complete the 24-week study will also be conducted for all
efficacy variables; this is referred to as a “completer” analysis.
Additionally, each of the efficacy variables will be analyzed at each time point both as
“actual cases,” that is, analyzing the data collected at the various time points, and also as
Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)

a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF). Note that the LOCF analysis at 24 weeks is
the same as the endpoint analysis described previously.
Several additional analyses of NPI-X will be conducted. Data from this instrument will
be collected every 2 weeks, and represent not the condition of the patient at that moment
in time, but rather the worst condition of the patient in the time period since the most
recent NPI-X administration. For this reason, the primary analysis of the NPI-X will be
of the average of all postrandomization NPI-X subscores except for the one obtained at
Week 2. In the event of early discontinuations, those scores that correspond to the
interval between Weeks 2 to 24 will be averaged. The reason for excluding Week 2 data
from this analysis is that patients could be confused about when a behavior actually stops
after randomization; the data obtained at Week 2 could be somewhat “tainted.” Also, by
requiring 2 weeks of therapy prior to use of the NPI-X data, the treatment difference
should be maximized by giving the drug 2 weeks to work, thereby increasing the
statistical power. Secondary analyses of the NPI-X will include the average of all
postrandomization weeks, including measures obtained at Weeks 2 and 26.

4.3.3. Statistical Methodology
The primary method to be used for the primary efficacy variables described in Sections
4.3.1 and 4.3.2 will be analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), except for CIBIC+ which is a
score that reflects change from baseline, so there is no corresponding baseline CIBIC+
score. Effects in the ANCOVA model will be the corresponding baseline score,
investigator, and treatment. CIBIC+ will be analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA),
with effects in the model being investigator and treatment. Investigator-by-treatment
interaction will be tested in a full model prior to conducting the primary ANCOVA or
ANOVA (see description below).
Because 3 treatment groups are involved, the primary analysis will be the test for linear
dose response in the ANCOVA and ANOVA models described in the preceding
paragraph. The result is then a single p-value for each of ADAS-Cog and CIBIC+.
Analysis of the secondary efficacy variables will also be ANCOVA. Pairwise treatment
comparisons of the adjusted means for all efficacy variables will be conducted using a
LSMEANS statement within the GLM procedure.
Investigator-by-treatment interaction will be tested in a full ANCOVA or ANOVA
model, which takes the models described above, and adds the interaction term to the
model. Interaction will be tested at D= .10 level. When the interaction is significant at
this level, the data will be examined for each individual investigator to attempt to identify
the source of the significant interaction. When the interaction is not significant, this term
will be dropped from the model as described above, to test for investigator and treatment
main effects. By doing so, all ANCOVA and ANOVA models will be able to validly test
for treatment differences without weighting each investigator equally, which is what
occurs when using Type III sums of squares (cell means model) with the interaction term
Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Document Page 43

present in the model. This equal weighting of investigators can become a serious
problem when sample sizes are dramatically different between investigators.
For all ANOVA and ANCOVA models, data collected from investigators who enrolled
fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group will be combined prior to analysis. If
this combination still results in a treatment group having fewer than 3 patients in any one
treatment group, then this group of patients will be combined with the next fewestenrolling investigator. In the event that there is a tie for fewest-enrolling investigator,
one of these will be chosen at random by a random-number generator.
The inherent assumption of normally distributed data will be evaluated by generating
output for the residuals from the full ANCOVA and ANOVA models, which include the
interaction term, and by testing for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test from PROC
UNIVARIATE. In the event that the data are predominantly nonnormally distributed,
analyses will also be conducted on the ranked data. This rank transformation will be
applied by ranking all the data for a particular variable, across all investigators and
treatments, from lowest to highest. Integer ranks will be assigned starting at 1; mean
ranks will be assigned when ties occur.
In addition, the NPI-X will be analyzed in a manner similar to typical analyses of adverse
events. In this analysis, each behavior will be considered individually. This analysis is
referred to as “treatment-emergent signs and symptoms” (TESS) analysis. For each
behavior, the patients will be dichotomized into 1 of 2 groups: those who experienced
the behavior for the first time postrandomization, or those who had the quotient between
frequency and severity increase relative to the baseline period defines one group. All
other patients are in the second group. Treatments will be compared for overall
differences by Cochran-Mantel-Haentzel (CMH) test referred to in SAS£ as “row mean
scores differ,” 2 degrees of freedom. The CMH correlation statistic (1 degree of freedom
test), will test for increasing efficacy with increasing dose (trend test).

4.3.4. One-sided Justification
All comparisons between xanomeline and placebo with respect to efficacy variables
should be one-sided. The justification for this follows.
The statistical hypothesis that is tested needs to be consistent with the ultimate data-based
decision that is reached. When conducting placebo-controlled trials, it is imperative that
the drug be demonstrated to be superior in efficacy to placebo, since equivalent or worse
efficacy than placebo will preclude approvability. Consequently, a one-sided test for
efficacy is required.
The null hypothesis is that the drug is equal or worse than placebo. The alternative
hypothesis is that the drug has greater efficacy than placebo. A Type I error occurs only
when it is concluded that a study drug is effective when in fact it is not. This can occur
in only one tail of the distribution of the treatment difference. Further details of the
Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Document Page 44

arguments for one-sided tests in placebo-controlled trials are available in statistical
publications (Fisher 1991; Koch 1991; Overall 1991; and Peace 1991).
The argument for one-sided tests does not necessarily transfer to safety measures, in
general, because one can accept a certain level of toxicity in the presence of strong
efficacy. That is, safety is evaluated as part of a benefit/risk ratio.
Note that this justification is similar to that used by regulatory agencies worldwide that
routinely require one-sided tests for toxicological oncogenicity studies. In that case, the
interest is not in whether a drug seems to lessen the occurrence of cancer; the interest is
in only one tail of the distribution, namely whether the drug causes cancer to a greater
extent than the control.
Different regulatory agencies require different type I error rates. Treatment differences
that are significant at the .025 D-level will be declared to be “statistically significant.”
When a computed p-value falls between .025 and .05, the differences will be described as
“marginally statistically significant.” This approach satisfies regulatory agencies who
have accepted a one-sided test at the .05 level, and other regulatory agencies who have
requested a two-sided test at the .05 level, or equivalently, a one-sided test at the .025
level. In order to facilitate the review of the final study report, two-sided p-values will be
presented in addition to the one-sided p-values.

4.3.5. Nominal P-value Adjustments
When there are multiple outcomes, and the study drug is declared to be effective when at
least one of these outcomes achieves statistical significance in comparison with a placebo
control, a downward adjustment to the nominal D-level is necessary. A well-known
simple method is the Bonferroni method, that divides the overall Type I error rate,
usually .05, by the number of multiple outcomes. So, for example, if there are two
multiple outcomes, the study drug is declared to be effective if at least one of the two
outcomes is significant at the .05/2 or .025 level.
However, when one has the situation that is present in this study, where there are 2 (or 3
for Europe) outcome variables, each of which must be statistically significant, then the
adjustment of the nominal levels is in the opposite direction, that is upwards, in order to
maintain an overall Type 1 error rate of .05.
In the case of two outcomes, ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+, if the two variables were
completely independent, then each variable should be tested at the nominal D-level of
.051/2 = .2236 level. So if both variables resulted in a nominal p-value less than or equal
to .2236, then we would declare the study drug to be effective at the overall Type 1 error
rate of .05.
We expect these two outcome measures to be correlated. From the first large-scale
efficacy study of oral xanomeline, Study MC-H2Q-LZZA, the correlation between
CIBIC+ and the change in ADAS-Cog(11) from baseline was .252. Consequently, we
Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)

Document Page 45

plan to conduct a randomization test to combine these two dependent dose-response pvalues into a single test, which will then be at the .05 Type I error level. Because there
will be roughly 300!/(3 * 100!) possible permutations of the data, random data
permutations will be sampled (10,000 random permutations).
Designate the dose response p-values as p1 and p2 (computed as one-sided p-values), for
ADAS-Cog(11) and CIBIC+, respectively. The rejection region is defined as
[ {p1 d D and p2 d D} ].
The critical value, D, will be determined from the 10,000 random permutations by
choosing the value of D to be such that 2.5% of the 10,000 computed pairs of dose
response p-values fall in the rejection region. This will correspond to a one-sided test at
the .025 level, or equivalently a two-sided test at the .05 level. In addition, by
determining the percentage of permuted samples that are more extreme than the observed
data, a single p-value is obtained.

4.4. Safety Analyses
Although safety data is collected at the 24 week visit for retrieved dropouts, these data
will not be included in the primary analysis of safety.
Pearson’s chi-square test will be used to analyze 3 reasons for study discontinuation
(protocol completed, lack of efficacy, and adverse event), the incidence of abnormal
(high or low) laboratory measures during the postrandomization phase, and the incidence
of treatment-emergent adverse events. The analysis of laboratory data is conducted by
comparing the measures to the normal reference ranges (based on a large Lilly database),
and counting patients in the numerator if they ever had a high (low) value during the
postrandomization phase.
Additionally, for the continuous laboratory tests, an analysis of change from baseline to
endpoint will be conducted using the same ANOVA model described for the efficacy
measures in Section 4.3. Because several laboratory analytes are known to be nonnormally distributed (skewed right), these ANOVAs will be conducted on the ranks.
Several outcome measures will be extracted and analyzed from the Ambulatory ECG
tapes, including number of pauses, QT interval, and AV block (first, second, or third
degree). The primary consideration will be the frequency of pauses. The number of
pauses greater than or equal to 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 seconds will be tabulated. Primary
analysis will focus on the number of pauses greater than or equal to 3 seconds. Due to
possible outliers, these data will be analyzed as the laboratory data, by ANOVA on the
ranks.
Treatment-emergent adverse events (also referred to as treatment-emergent signs and
symptoms, or TESS) are defined as any event reported during the postrandomization

Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)

Document Page 46

period (Weeks 0 - 26) that is worse in severity than during the baseline period, or one that
occurs for the first time during the postrandomization period.

4.5. Subgroup Analyses
The effect of age, gender, origin, baseline disease severity as measured by MMSE, Apo
E, and patient education level upon efficacy will be evaluated if sample sizes are
sufficient to warrant such analyses. For example, if all patients are Caucasian, then there
is no need to evaluate the co-factor origin. The ANCOVA and ANOVA models
described above will be supplemented with terms for the main effect and interaction with
treatment. Each co-factor will be analyzed in separate models. The test for treatment-bysubgroup interaction will address whether the response to xanomeline, compared with
placebo, is different or consistent between levels of the co-factor.

4.6. Interim Efficacy Analyses
Two interim efficacy analyses are planned. The first interim analysis will occur when
approximately 50% of the patients have completed 8 weeks; the second interim analysis
is to be conducted when approximately 50% of the patients have completed 24 weeks of
the study. The purpose of these interim analyses is to provide a rationale for the
initiation of subsequent studies of xanomeline TTS, or if the outcome is negative to stop
development of xanomeline TTS. The method developed by Enas and Offen (1993) will
be used as a guideline as to whether or not to stop one treatment arm, or the study, to
declare ineffectiveness. The outcome of the interim analyses will not affect in any way
the conduct, results, or analysis of the current study, unless the results are so negative
that they lead to a decision to terminate further development of xanomeline TTS in AD.
Hence, adjustments to final computed p-values are not appropriate.
Planned interim analyses, and any unplanned interim analyses, will be conducted under
the auspices of the data monitoring board assigned to this study. Only the data
monitoring board is authorized to review completely unblinded interim efficacy and
safety analyses and, if necessary, to disseminate those results. The data monitoring board
will disseminate interim results only if absolutely necessary. Any such dissemination
will be documented and described in the final study report. Study sites will not receive
information about interim results unless they need to know for the safety of their patients.

4.7. Interim Safety Analyses
An analysis of the cardiovascular safety monitoring (see section 3.9.4) will be performed
when approximately 25 patients from each treatment arm have completed at least 2
weeks at the treatment arms’ respective full dosage (Visit 5). If necessary, this analysis
will be repeated every 25 patients per arm. This analysis will be conducted under the
auspices of the DSMB. This board membership will be composed of 3 external
Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)

cardiologists who will be the voting members of the board, a Lilly cardiologist, a Lilly
statistician, and the Lilly research physician in charge of the study. Only the DSMB is
authorized to review completely unblinded cardiovascular safety analyses and, if
necessary, to disseminate those results. The outcome of the cardiovascular safety
analyses will determine the need for further Ambulatory ECGs.

4.8. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Plasma concentrations of xanomeline will be determined from samples obtained at
selected visits (Section 3.9.2). The plasma concentration data for xanomeline, dosing
information, and patient characteristics such as weight, gender and origin will be pooled
and analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic analysis approach (for example,
NONMEM). This approach preserves the individual pharmacokinetic differences
through structural and statistical models. The population pharmacokinetic parameters
through the structural model, and the interindividual and random residual variability
through the components of the statistical models will be estimated. An attempt will also
be made to correlate plasma concentrations with efficacy and safety data by means of
population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling.

5. Informed Consent, Ethical Review, and Regulatory
Considerations
5.1. Informed Consent
In the United States and Canada, the investigator is responsible for preparing the
informed consent document. The investigator will use information provided in the
current [Clinical Investigator's Brochure or product information] to prepare the informed
consent document.
The informed consent document will be used to explain in simple terms, before the
patient is entered into the study, the risks and benefits to the patient. The informed
consent document must contain a statement that the consent is freely given, that the
patient is aware of the risks and benefits of entering the study, and that the patient is free
to withdraw from the study at any time.
As used in this protocol, the term “informed consent” includes all consent and/or assent
given by subjects, patients, or their legal representatives.
In addition to the elements required by all applicable laws, the 3 numbered paragraphs
below must be included in the informed consent document. The language may be altered
to match the style of the informed consent document, providing the meaning is
unchanged. In some circumstances, local law may require that the text be altered in a
way that changes the meaning. These changes can be made only with specific Lilly
approval. In these cases, the ethical review board may request from the investigator
documentation evidencing Lilly’s approval of the language in the informed consent
document, which would be different from the language contained in the protocol. Lilly
shall, upon request, provide the investigator with such documentation.
1.

“I understand that the doctors in charge of this study, or Lilly, may
stop the study or stop my participation in the study at any time, for any
reason, without my consent.”

2.

“I hereby give permission for the doctors in charge of this study to
release the information regarding, or obtained as a result of, my
participation in this study to Lilly, including its agents and contractors;
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other governmental
agencies; and to allow them to inspect all my medical records. I
understand that medical records that reveal my identity will remain
confidential, except that they will be provided as noted above or as
may be required by law.”

“If I follow the directions of the doctors in charge of this study and I
am physically injured because of any substance or procedure properly
given me under the plan for this study, Lilly will pay the medical
expenses for the treatment of that injury which are not covered by my
own insurance, by a government program, or by any other third party.
No other compensation is available from Lilly if any injury occurs.”

The investigator is responsible for obtaining informed consent from each patient or legal
representative and for obtaining the appropriate signatures on the informed consent
document prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the
administration of study drug.

5.2. Ethical Review
The name and address of the ethical review board are listed on the Investigator/Contacts
cover pages provided with this protocol.
The investigator will provide Lilly with documentation of ethical review board approval
of the protocol and the informed consent document before the study may begin at the site
or sites concerned. The ethical review board(s) will review the protocol as required.
The investigator must provide the following documentation:
x

The ethical review board’s annual reapproval of the protocol

x

The ethical review board’s approvals of any revisions to the informed
consent document or amendments to the protocol.

5.3. Regulatory Considerations
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the most
recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki or the applicable guidelines on good clinical
practice, whichever represents the greater protection of the individual.
After reading the protocol, each investigator will sign 2 protocol signature pages and
return 1 of the signed pages to a Lilly representative (see Attachment LZZT.10).

Protocol Attachment LZZT.2
Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog)
With Attention/Concentration Tasks

Background Information
The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment ScaleCognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) is an
instrument devised to assess the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The scale includes short neuropsychological tests in which
the patient performs simple tasks such as word recall, word recognition, and
constructional praxis. The cognitive section of the ADAS consists of 11 items which
assess the following: memory, language (aphasia), and motor skills (praxis).
Rosen et al (1984) evaluated the test-retest and interrater reliabilities of the individual
scale items and the entire scale in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. The
ADAS was shown to be valid (Rosen et al, 1984) in the ability to detect patients with
clinically diagnosed AD from matched nondemented controls. Kramer-Ginzberg et al
(1988) demonstrated at 12 month and 24 month retesting that higher scores on the ADAS
correlated with disease progression. Because both of the above cognitive and
noncognitive parameters are assessed, the ADAS is a reliable instrument for use in
psychopharmacologic trials involving patients with AD.
Three additional items have been incorporated into this scale to asses the
attention/concentration level of the patient. The three additional tasks are delayed word
recall, attention/visual search task, and maze solution. These tasks and their rating scales
were developed by the author of the ADAS-Cog.
Equipment Needed:
The following props are needed to carry out the ADAS-Cog with attention/concentration
tasks:
1. Toys which are replicas of the objects to be named.
2. Sets of index cards for the word recall, delayed word recall and word recognition
items. For each administration of the ADAS there is a designated set of cards
specific for that visit and the words are different for each visit.
3. Scaled drawings of the forms that the patients will copy.
4. Sets of mazes for the maze solution task.
5. Sets of numbers and letters for the attention/visual search task.

All of these items will be supplied by Eli Lilly and Company.

Test Administration and Scoring
The ADAS-Cog with attention/concentration tasks should be administered by a health
care professional trained to do so. The test will take approximately 30-45 minutes to
complete and involves interviewing the patient alone.
There are a total of 11 items which assess cognitive function and 3 which assess
attention/concentration. The maximum total score is 90. 70 points are possible on the
cognitive section and 20 points on the attention/concentration section. The higher the
score, the greater is the degree of cognitive impairment.
The following is the sequence in which the ADAS-Cog with attention/concentration tasks
is to be administered along with test instructions and scoring guidelines:
1.

Word Recall

The patient reads aloud 10 high imagery-words exposed for 2 seconds each. The patient
then recalls the words aloud. Three trials of reading and recall are given. On the
worksheet, check each word recalled correctly. The words not checked are added and the
total score is divided by 3 to generate a score for this item. The score equals the mean
number of words not recalled on the 3 trials (maximum = 10).
2.

Naming Objects and Fingers

The patient is asked to name 12 randomly presented real objects, with frequency
identification levels of high, medium, and low. For those patients having difficulty
naming objects, standard clues may be used. The following is a list of the objects, their
frequency of identification, and clues:

Also, ask the patient to name the fingers of his dominant hand; thumb, pinky (little
finger), index (pointer, forefinger), middle and ring fingers.
Check each object/finger on the worksheet named correctly. In order to correctly score,
the patient must name each object exactly as stated on the worksheet, exceptions include
wallet which could also be called a billfold, index finger which could also be referred to
as the pointer or forefinger and pinky which could also be called little finger.
Add the number of empty boxes and then score this item using the following scale:
Items = objects and fingers named
0 = 0-2 items named incorrectly
1 = 3-5 items named incorrectly
2 = 6-8 items named incorrectly
3 = 9-11 items named incorrectly
4 = 12-14 items named incorrectly
5 = 15-17 items named incorrectly
3.

Delayed Word Recall

The patient is asked if they remember any of the 10 words used in the first task. On the
worksheet, check each word recalled correctly. The words not checked are added to
generate a score for this task. (maximum = 10)
4.

Commands

The patient is instructed to perform the following 5 commands. Receptive speech is
assessed based on the patient’s ability to carry out 1 to 5 step commands.
1. Make a fist.
2. Point to the ceiling and then to the floor.
Line up a pencil, watch, and card on the table in front of the patient.
3. Put the pencil on top of the card and then put it back.
4. Put the watch on the other side of the pencil and then turn over the card.
5. Tap each shoulder twice, with two fingers, keeping your eyes shut.

Each underlined word represents a single step. The command may be repeated
once by the interviewer. Each command is scored as a whole. That is, each part
of the command must be performed accurately to obtain credit for that item. One
the worksheet, check each command performed correctly and then add up the
empty boxes. The scale for scoring this item is as follows:
0 = no errors, all 5 commands correct
1 = 1 command incorrect, 4 commands correct
2 = 2 commands incorrect, 3 commands correct
3 = 3 commands incorrect, 2 commands correct
4 = 4 commands incorrect, 1 command correct
5 = all 5 commands incorrect
5.

Constructional Praxis

This item assesses the patient’s ability to copy 4 geometric forms. These forms, in the
order of presentation are:
1. Circle: approximately 2.0 cm in diameter
2. Two overlapping rectangles: the vertical rectangle is 2.0 cm x 2.5 cm, and the
horizontal rectangle is 1.0 cm x 3.5 cm.
3. Rhombus: each side = 2.0 cm, acute angle = 50 degrees, obtuse angle =
degrees

130

4. Cube: each side = 2.0 cm, internal lines are present.

Each figure is located in the upper middle of a 5 1/2 x 8 1/2 sheet of paper. The patient is
instructed: “Do you see this figure? Make one that looks like the one anywhere on
the paper.” Two attempts are permitted. One the worksheet check each figure drawn
correctly. The scoring of this item is as follows:
1 = 1 form drawn incorrectly
2 = 2 forms drawn incorrectly
3 = 3 forms drawn incorrectly
4 = 4 forms drawn incorrectly
5 = no figures drawn: scribbles, parts of forms, words instead of forms

Document Page 59

Scoring criteria for each form:
1. Circle: a closed figure
2. Two overlapping rectangles: forms must be 4-sided and overlap must be similar
to presented form. Changes in size are not scored.
3. Rhombus (diamond): figure must be 4-sided obliquely oriented, and the sides
approximately equal in length. Four measurements are taken.
These are: ac, a'c, bc, b'c.
The ratio of ac/a'c or a'c/ac ranges from 0.75 to 1.00.
The ratio of bc/b'c or b'c/bc ranges from 0.60 to 1.00.
The ratio bb'/aa' ranges from 0.30 to 0.75.
The figure is incorrect if any ratio is outside these ranges.
4. Cube: the form is 3-dimensional, with front face in the correct orientation,
internal lines drawn correctly between corners. If opposite sides of faces are not
parallel by more than 20 degrees, it is incorrect (insert examples of drawings).
6.

Ideational Praxis

The patient is given a 8 1/2" x 11" sheet of paper and a long envelope. The patient is
instructed to pretend to send a letter to himself. The patient is told to fold the paper, put
the paper into the envelope, seal it, address it to himself, and to indicate where the stamp
goes.
If the patient forgets part of the task or is having difficulty, reinstruction should be given.
Impairment on this term should only reflect dysfunction in executing an overlearned task
only and not recall difficulty. The 5 components to this task are:
1. fold letter
2. put letter in envelope
3. seal envelope
4. address envelope (any address containing: name, street, city, state, and zip code
is correct)
5. mark where stamp goes

On the worksheet check each step completed correctly. Scoring this item is as follows:
0 = able to perform all components
1 = failure to perform 1 component
2 = failure to perform 2 components
3 = failure to perform 3 components
4 = failure to perform 4 components
5 = failure to perform 5 components
7.

Orientation

The patient is asked questions which assess orientation. The components of orientation
assessed are: full name, month, date, year, day, season, place, and time of day. On the
worksheet check each correct response. One point is given for each incorrect response
(maximum of 8). Acceptable answers include 1 day either way within the date: within 1
hour for the hour, partial name for place, naming the upcoming season if it is 1 week
prior to its onset, or naming the previous season for two weeks after its termination.
8.

Word Recognition Task

The patient reads aloud 12 high-imagery words presented on index cards. Then these
words are mixed in randomly with 12 new words. The patient indicates if he has
previously seen the word by saying “yes” or “old” and if the word is new by saying “no”
or “new.” Two more trials of reading the original words and recognition are given. On
the worksheet check each word recalled correctly. Words that are starred are the original
words and patients should answer by saying “yes” or “old.” Words that are not starred
are new words and the patient should respond by saying “no” or “new.” The score equals
the mean number of incorrect responses for 3 trials (maximum 12).
9.

Attention/Visual Search Task

Place the example face up in front of the subject. Say to the subject “This is an example
of the task we are about to do. On the top of this page is a number (or in some cases a
number and letter). Throughout the page you will find this number mixed in with the
other numbers. I’d like you to begin here (point to the beginning of the first line), and
going across line by line, cross out any number that matches the number at the top of the
page. Please work as quickly as you can.” Discontinue the example after 30 seconds.
Prior to each task, you may repeat the instructions to the subject. Discontinue each task
after 60 seconds. (maximum = 40 targets)
10. Maze Solution Task

The subject will be required to attempt each maze in order of difficulty. Difficulty was
varied by manipulating features of the maze such as the number of turns, number of

Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Document Page 61

decision points, and length of dead end routes. There is a time limit of 240 seconds for
each maze. Two errors, or reaching the 240 second time limit constitutes a failure.
Show the example. Tell them to start where it says “start” and find their way outside the
maze. Show them where they would come out. Tell them to try not to run into any dead
ends or cross solid lines. You can help them in the example if they hit a dead end. If
they hit a dead end during the test you may show them the correct path once. (maximum
= 240 seconds)
Language

Language abilities are evaluated throughout the interview and on specific tests.
Questions eliciting “yes” or “no” answers assess comprehension on a very basic level.
Other questions require recall of specific information and well developed communication
skills. The following 4 items (8-11) assess spoken language ability, comprehension,
remembering test instructions and word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech.
11.

Spoken Language Ability

This item is a global rating of the quality of the patient’s speech such as clarity and
difficulty in making oneself understood. Quantity and word finding difficulty are not
rated on this item. The scoring for this item is as follows:
0 = no impairment: patient speaks clearly and is understandable
1 = very mild: 1 instance of lack of understandability
2 = mild: patient has difficulty <25% of the time
3 = moderate: patient has difficulty 25-50% of the time
4 = moderately severe: patient has difficulty more than 50% of the time
5 = severe: only 1 or 2 utterances, clued by empty speech, mute
12.

Comprehension

This item evaluates the patient’s ability to understand speech. Do not include responses
to commands. The scoring for this item is as follows:
0 = no impairment: patient understands
1 = very mild: 1 instance of misunderstanding
2 = mild: 2-5 instances of misunderstanding
3 = moderate: requires several repetitions and rephrasing
4 = moderately severe: patient only occasionally responds correctly (that is, to yes
questions)
5 = severe: patient rarely responds to questions appropriately, not due to poverty of
speech

13.

Word-Finding Difficulty in Spontaneous Speech

This item assesses whether the patient has difficulty in finding the desired word in
spontaneous speech. The problem may be circumlocution (that is, giving explanatory
phrases) or substituting nearly satisfactory synonyms. The score represents a subjective
rating by the interviewer. Do not include responses to the finger or object naming during
the testing in this rating. The scoring for this item is as follows:
0 = none
1 = very mild: 1 or 2 instances, not clinically significant
2 = mild: noticeable circumlocution or synonym substitution
3 = moderate: loss of words without compensation on occasion
4 = moderately severe: frequent loss of words without compensation

5 = severe: nearly total loss of content words, speech sounds empty, 1-2 word
utterances
14.

Recall of Test Instructions

The patient’s ability to remember the requirements of the word recognition task is
evaluated. On each recognition trial, the patient is asked prior to presentation of the first
2 words, “Did you see this word before or is this a new word?” For the third word, the
patient is asked, "How about this one?" If the patient responds appropriately (that is,
“yes” or “no”) then the recall of the instruction is accurate. If the patient fails to respond,
this signifies that the instructions have been forgotten. Then instruction is repeated. The
procedure used for the third word is repeated for words 4-24. Each instance of recall
failure is noted. The scoring for this item is as follows:
0 = no impairment
1 = very mild: forgets once
2 = mild: must be reminded 2 times
3 = moderate: must be reminded 3 or 4 times
4 = moderately severe: must be reminded 5 or 6 times
5 = severe: must be reminded 7 or more times

Video-referenced Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression
of Change CIBIC+ Rating Scale

Background Information

Global ratings are intended to provide an index of clinical importance of change that
cannot be obtained from quantitative assessment measures such as mental status
examinations. The Video-referenced Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change
(CIBIC+) has been designed to observe the patient’s behavior in a cumulative global
sense (as opposed to rating each behavior for the purpose of deriving a scored severity).
The majority of the interview appears somewhat conversational (except for certain items,
for example, those items seeking evidence of disturbed praxis) yet it samples behaviors
that might be affected by AD. The seemingly informal tone of the CIBIC+ interview is
designed to reduce the discomfort that a patient might feel when placed in a traditional
testing environment. Since the interview is not scored and it’s intent is to elicit
standardized patient behaviors that will provide the clinician with a global impression of
change.
Test Administration

A semi-structured interview should be used to assess global change. Provided are
worksheets to be used by the clinician to assess 3 domains: cognitive/mental status,
functioning, and behaviors. The worksheets provided should be used as a tool and not to
exclude any other method of assessment used by a clinician. No particular format or
order is suggested for the interview.

Protocol Attachment LZZT.4
Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X)

Background Information

The neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) (Cummings et al. 1994) was developed to assess
behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia patients: delusions, hallucinations,
agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria,
apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/liability, aberrant motor activity, sleep, and
appetite and eating disorders. The NPI uses a screening strategy to immunize
administration, examining and scoring only those behavioral domains with positive
responses to screening questions. Frequency, severity and caregiver distress of each
behavior are determined.
Test Administration

The NPI should be administered by a health care professional trained to do so.
Information for the inventory may be obtained from the spouse or other person intimately
familiar with the patients behavior. The NPI is administered at every clinic visit, plus
twice via the telephone when patients are not required to come to the clinic.
Questions should be asked exactly as written. Clarification’s should be provided if the
caregiver does not understand the questions. The answers pertain to changes in patient’s
behavior that have appeared since the onset of the illness.
Delusions

Does the patient have beliefs that you know are not true? For example, insisting that
people are trying to harm him/her. Has he/she said that family members are not who they
say they are; or that the house is not their home? I’m not asking about mere
suspiciousness; I am interested if the patient is convinced that these things are happening
to him/her.
Hallucinations

Does the patient have hallucinations such as false visions or voices? Does he/she seem to
see, hear or experience things that are not present? By this questions we do not mean just
mistaken beliefs such as stating that someone who has died is still alive: rather we are
asking if the patient actually has abnormal experiences of sounds, or visions.

Xanomeline (LY246708) H2Q-MC-LZZT(c)
Clinical Study Protocol

Document Page 75

Agitation/Aggression

Does the patient does have periods when he/she refuses to cooperate or won’t let people
help him/her? Is he/she hard to handle?
Depression/Dysphoria

Does the patient seem sad or depressed? Does he/she say that he/she feels sad or
depressed?
Anxiety

Is the patient very nervous, worried, or frightened for no apparent reason? Does he/she
seem very tense or fidgety? Is the patient afraid to be apart from you?
Elation/Euphoria

Does the patient seem too cheerful or too happy for no reason? I don’t mean the normal
happiness that comes from seeing friends, receiving presents, or spending time with
family members. I am asking if the patient has a persistent and abnormally good mood or
finds humor where others do not.
Apathy/Indifference

Has the patient lost interest in the world around him/her? Has he/she lost interest in
doing things or lack motivation for starting new activities? Is he/she more difficult to
engage in conversation or in doing chores? Is the patient apathetic or indifferent?
Disinhibition

Does the patient seem to act impulsively without thinking? Does he/she do or say things
that are not usually done or did in public? Does he/she do things that are embarrassing to
you or others?
Irritability/Lability

Does the patient get irritated and easily disturbed? Are his/her moods very changeable?
Is he/she abnormally impatient? We do not mean frustration over memory loss or
inability to perform usual tasks; we are interested to know if the patient has abnormal
irritability , impatience, or rapid emotional changes different from his/her usual self.

Aberrant Motor Behavior

Does the patient pace, do things over and over such as opening closets or drawers, or
repeatedly pick at things or wind string or threads?
Night-time Behaviors

Does the patient have difficulty sleeping (do not count as present if the patient simply
gets up once or twice per night only to go to the bathroom and falls back asleep
immediately)? Is he/she up at night? Does he she wander at night, get dressed, or disturb
your sleep?
Appetite and Eating Disorders

Has he/she had any change in appetite, weight, or eating habits ( count as NA if the
patient is incapacitated and has to be fed)? Has there been any change in type of food
he/she prefers?
Frequency:
1.

Occasionally - less than once per week.

2.

Often - about once per week.

3.

Frequently - several times per week but less than every day.

4.

Very Frequently - once or more per day.

Severity:
1.

Mild - delusions present but seem harmless and produce little
distress in the patient.

2.

Moderate - delusions are distressing and disruptive.

3.

Marked - delusions are very disruptive and are a major source of
behavioral disruption. (If PRN medications are prescribed,
their use signals that the delusions are of marked severity.)

Distress:

How emotionally distressing do you find this behavior?

0. Not at all
1. Minimally
2. Mildly
3. Moderately

Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)

Background Information
The Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) scale quantitatively measures functional
abilities in activities of daily living (ADL) in individuals with cognitive impairments
such as dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Basic and instrumental ADLs are
examined in relation to executive skills to delineate areas of cognitive deficits which may
impair performance in ADL. The DAD is intended specifically for the assessment of
disability in community residing individuals with cognitive deficits such as DAT and
other dementias.
This measure of functional disability is based on the model of health proposed by the
World Health Organization (WHO). In accordance with this model, functional disability
refers to any restriction in the ability to perform an activity, a task or a behavior of every
day life such as basic self-care or instrumental activities.
Functional disability is measured with the DAD scale through the assessment of basic,
instrumental, and leisure activities. The DAD scale includes:
Basic activities of daily living: Activities that are important for self-care which
are dressing, hygiene, continence, and eating.
Instrumental activities of daily living: Activities that are important for
maintenance in a specific environment which are meal preparation, telephoning,
housework, taking care of finance and correspondence, going on an outing, taking
medications, and ability to stay safely at home.
Leisure activities: Activities that are beyond the mean of self maintenance and
for the purpose of recreation which are assessed in terms of interest that is shown
towards these activities.
To understand the cognitive dimensions of disabilities in ADL within the DAD scale, the
above measured ADLs have been further subdivided according to executive functions
which have showed regression patterns in dementias. These are initiation, planning, and
organization, and effective performance.
Initiation consists of the ability to decide and/or start an action. This requires
spontaneity on the part of the individual and must be accomplished at an
appropriate moment and place.
Planning and organization consists of the ability to identify the different
components of a task, to be able to structure them in an appropriate sequence, to
elaborate a strategy for action, and to be able to prepare the required material

Document Page 80

prior to the action. It also includes the ability to monitor actions during the
activity which involves problem solving and decision making abilities to make
appropriate corrections when needed.
Effective performance consists of the ability to complete an action. The quality
of the performance with regards to whether the task is done in a safe and
acceptable manner is also an important component.
Test Administration and Scoring
The DAD is administered through interview with the caregiver in a quiet environment.
Administration takes approximately 15 minutes. The DAD is a measure of the actual
performance in ADLs of the individual as observed over a period of 2 weeks up to the
time of the interview. Activities are evaluated as performed without any assistance or
reminder being provided from caregivers. Questions must be formulated and clarified
in this sense.
**** Questions should be given as follows:
“During the past two weeks, did Mr./Ms. X without help or reminder ....”
It is essential to use the exact wording in order to respect content validity. Elements in
brackets should be read. The choice of answer should be specified at the beginning of
the interview and should be repeated throughout. Scoring for each question is
determined as follows:
Yes = 1
No = 0
Non applicable (N/A) = 96
Yes indicates that the person has performed the activity without help or reminder in the
last two weeks even if it was only performed once.
No signifies that the person could not perform the activity without help or reminder.
Therefore, if a person has performed the activity with some assistance from the caregiver,
verbal or physical, he/she is scored as a No.
N/A signifies that the individual never used to do it before the occurrence of DAT or did
not have the opportunity to do it in the past two weeks.

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)

Background Information

The MMSE is a brief assessment instrument used to assess cognitive function in elderly
patients. The MMSE can be used to screen for cognitive impairment and as a
measurement of cognition over time and with pharmacologic treatment. The instrument
is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention:
the maximum score is 21. The second section tests the ability of the patient to name
objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures: the
maximum score is 9. The scoring range for the MMSE is 0-30.
Folstein et al (1975) demonstrated the MMSE to be both reliable and valid in a group of
elderly subjects: including those with dementia, depression with cognitive impairment,
depression and “normal” elderly patients. The validity of the MMSE is demonstrated by
a positive correlation between the patients’ MMSE scores and their scores on both the
verbal and performance sections of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). The
MMSE has been shown to possess sensitivity and specificity in various populations.
Although the MMSE alone is unable to provide diagnostic information, the data on its
sensitivity and specificity in cognitively impaired patients demonstrates its utility as a
screening instrument.
Test Administration

The MMSE should be administered by a health care professional trained in its use. The
MMSE will be administered at Visit 1 (screening visit). The administration item of the
MMSE requires no more than 10 to 15 minutes. The interviewer should make the patient
comfortable and establish rapport. Inform the patient that you would like to ask him
questions to test his memory and concentration. It is important to acknowledge correct
responses, and to avoid applying pressure when a patient finds an item to be difficult.
Patients must score between 10 and 23 on this scale to be eligible for participation in this
study.
Dialogue for the Standardized Administration of the MMSE
Introduce the test by saying: “I would like to ask you some questions to test your
memory and concentration. Most of the questions will be easy, just follow my
instruction.”

“What year is it?”

b.

“What season is it?”

c.

“What is today’s date?”

d.

“What day of the week is today?”

e.

“What is the month?”

g.

“What county are we in?”

h.

“What town are we in?”

i.

“Can you tell me the name of this hospital?”

j.

“What floor of the building are we on?”

If the patient answered the above items correctly, indicate so by scoring 1 point for each
item correctly identified.
2.

Registration (3 points)

Say to the patient “Now I’d like to test your memory... I’m going to name 3 objects.
After I have said them, I want you to repeat them. Remember what they are
because I’m going to ask you to name them again in a few minutes.” Then say the
names of the items slowly and clearly. After you have said all 3 objects, ask the patient
to repeat them.
The first repetition determines the score, but keep saying all 3 words (up to 6 trials) until
the patient can repeat all 3. One point is given for each correct response.
3.

Attention and Calculation (5 points)

Instruct the patient: “Begin with 100 and count backwards by 7 and keep subtracting
until I tell you to stop.”
Stop after 5 subtractions (93, 86, 79, 72, 65). One point is given for each sequential
correct response. For example, 93, 86, 77, 72 score = 2; 93, 85, 78, 71, 64 score = 1.
If the patient cannot or refuses to perform this test, ask him to spell the word “world”
backwards. Score 1 point for each letter named in correct order. For example, dlrwo
score = 3; drlow = 1.

4.

Recall (3 points)

Ask the patient if he can recall the 3 objects you asked him to remember earlier. Give 1
point for each correct response.
5.

Naming (2 points)

Show the patient a wrist watch and ask “What is this called?”
Next show the patient a pencil and ask “What is this called?”
Score 1 point for each item named correctly.
6.

Repetition (1 point)

Ask the patient to repeat this phrase for you: “No if ands or buts.” Allow only 1 trial.
Score 1 point if the phrase is repeated correctly.
7.

Three Stage Command (3 points)

Have the patient follow this command, Point to a piece of paper which is on top of the
desk and say to the patient:
“Please take that piece of paper in your right hand, fold the paper in half with both
hands, and put the paper down on the floor.” Score 1 point for each underlined
segment correctly executed.
8.

Reading (1 point)

On a blank piece of paper print the sentence: “Close your eyes.” in letters large enough
for the patient to see clearly. Ask him to read the words on it and do what it says. Score
1 point if he actually closes his eyes.
9.

Writing (1 point)

Give the patient a blank piece of paper and ask him to write a sentence for you. Do not
dictate a sentence, it has to be written spontaneously. The sentence should have a
subject and a verb and make sense. Correct grammar and punctuation are not
necessary.
10.

Copying (1 point)

Instruct the patient to copy the intersecting pentagons exactly as they are drawn. All 10
angles must be present and 2 must intersect forming a quadrangle to score 1 point.
Tremor and rotation are ignored.

NINCDS/ADRDA GUIDELINES
Criteria for Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease
I.

The criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PROBABLE Alzheimer’s disease include:
x dementia established by clinical examination and documented by the Mini-Mental Test, Blessed Dementia Scale, or some
similar examination, and confirmed by neuropsychological tests;
x deficits in 2 or more areas of cognition;
xprogressive worsening of memory and other cognitive functions;
x no disturbance of consciousness;
x onset between ages 40 and 90, most often after age 65; and
x absence of systemic disorders or other brain diseases that in and of themselves could account for the progressive deficits in
memory and cognition.

II.

The diagnosis of PROBABLE Alzheimer’s disease is supported by:
x progressive deterioration of specific cognitive functions such as language (aphasia), motor skills (apraxia), and perception
(agnosia);
x impaired activities of daily living and altered patterns of behavior;
x family history of similar disorders, particularly if confirmed neuropathologically; and
x laboratory results of:
normal lumbar puncture as evaluated by standard techniques;
normal pattern or nonspecific changes in EEG, such as increased slow-wave activity; and
evidence of cerebral atrophy on CT with progression documented by serial observation.

III.

Other clinical features consistent with the diagnosis of PROBABLE Alzheimer’s disease, after exclusion of causes of dementia other
than Alzheimer’s disease, include:
x plateaus in the course of progression of the illness;
x associated symptoms of depression, insomnia, incontinence, delusions, illusions, hallucinations, catastrophic verbal, emotional,
or physical outbursts, sexual disorders, and weight loss;
x other neurologic abnormalities in some patients, especially with more advanced disease and including motor signs such as
increased muscle tone, myoclonus, or gait disorder;
x seizures in advanced disease; and
x CT normal for age.

IV.

Features that make the diagnosis of PROBABLE Alzheimer’s disease uncertain or unlikely include:
x sudden, apoplectic onset;
x focal neurologic findings such as hemiparesis, sensory loss, visual field deficits, and incoordination early in the course of the
illness; and
x seizures or gait disturbances at the onset or very early in the course of the illness.

V.

Clinical diagnosis of POSSIBLE Alzheimer’s disease:
x may be made on the basis of the dementia syndrome, in the absence of other neurologic, psychiatric, or systemic disorders
sufficient to cause dementia, and in the presence of variations in the onset, in the presentation, or in the clinical course;
x may be made in the presence of a second systemic or brain disorder sufficient to produce dementia, which is not considered to
be the cause of the dementia; and
x should be used in research studies when a single, gradually progressive severe cognitive deficit is identified in the absence of
other identifiable cause.

VI.

Criteria for diagnosis of DEFINITE Alzheimer’s disease are:
x the clinical criteria for probable Alzheimer’s disease and
x histopathologic evidence obtained from a biopsy or autopsy.

VII.

Classification of Alzheimer’s disease for research purposes should specify features that may differentiate subtypes of the disorder,
such as:
x familial occurrence;
x onset before age of 65;

Hachinski Ischemic Scale

Background Information

The Hachinski Ischemic Score (Hachinski et al. 1975) was devised to better distinguish
multi-infarct dementia (MID) from other types of dementia such as primary degenerative
dementia (PDD) and is commonly used as a screening tool to exclude patients with MID
from entrance into clinical trials assessing neuropsychopharmacologic therapy in patients
with AD. The Ischemic Score is based on a 13-item scale, which consists of clinical
features which may be consistent with vascular dementia.
Test Administration

The Hachinski Ischemic Score is to be completed at Visit 1 (screening visit). The scale
should be completed by the physician based on clinical information obtained from
diagnostic information and physical examination. The scale takes about 10 to 15 minutes
to complete depending on the availability of the data needed. Scores for the 13 items are
added together for a total score. Patients who score 5 or greater are more likely to have a
dementia of vascular etiology and are excluded from participating in the trial.

Instructions for Administration of the NPI
The purpose of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is to obtain information on the presence
of psychopathology in patients with brain disorders. The NPI was developed for application to
patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, but it may be useful in the assessment of
behavioral changes in other conditions. Twelve behavioral areas are included in the NPI:
Delusions
Hallucinations
Agitation
Depression
Anxiety
Euphoria

Apathy
Disinhibition
Irritability
Aberrant motor behavior
Night-time behaviors
Appetite and eating changes

The NPI is based on responses from an informed caregiver, preferably one living with the
patient. If an informed observer is not available, this instrument cannot be used or must be modified.
The interview is best conducted with the caregiver in the absence of the patient to facilitate an open
discussion of behaviors that may be difficult to describe with the patient present. Several points
should be made when you introduce the NPI interview to the caregiver:
•
•
•
•

Purpose of the interview
Ratings - frequency, severity, distress (described below)
Answers apply to behaviors that are new since the onset of the disease and have been present
for the past two weeks or other defined period
Questions can usually be answered with "yes" or "no" and responses should be brief

When beginning the inventory, say to the caregiver "These questions are designed to
evaluate your [husband's/wife's/etc] behavior. They can usually be answered ‘yes’ or ‘no’ so please
try to be brief in your responses." If the caregiver lapses into elaborate responses that provide little
useful information, they may be reminded of the need to be brief. Some of the issues raised with this
are very emotionally disturbing to caregivers and the interviewer should reassure the caregiver that
they will discuss the problems in more detail after completion of the inventory.
Questions should be asked exactly as written. Clarification should be provided if the
caregiver does not understand the question. Acceptable clarifications are restatements of the
questions in alternate terms.
The questions pertain to changes in the patient's behavior that have appeared since the
onset of the illness. Behaviors that have been present throughout the patient's life and have not
changed in the course of the illness are not scored even if they are abnormal (e.g., anxiety, depression). Behaviors that have been present throughout life but have changed since the illness are
scored (e.g., the patient has always been apathetic but there has been a notable increase in apathy
during the period of inquiry).
The NPI is typically used to assess changes in the patient's behavior that have appeared in
a defined period of time (e.g., in the past four weeks or other defined interval). In some studies, the
NPI may be used to address changes occurring in response to treatment or that have changed since
the last clinic visit. The time frame of the question would then be revised to reflect this interest in
recent changes. Emphasize to the caregiver that the questions pertain to behaviors that have
appeared or changed since the onset of the illness. For example, the questions might be phrased
"Since he/she began treatment with the new medications . . ." or "Since our last interview . . ."
The screening question is asked to determine if the behavioral change is present or absent.
If the answer to the screening question is negative, mark NO and proceed to the next screening
question without asking the subquestions. If the answer to the screening question is positive or if
there are any

uncertainties in the caregiver's response or any inconsistencies between the response and other
information known by the clinician (e.g., the caregiver responds negatively to the euphoria screening
question but the patient appears euphoric to the clinician), the category is marked YES and is
explored in more depth with the subquestions. If the subquestions confirm the screening question,
the severity and frequency of the behavior are determined according to the criteria provided with each
behavior. When determining frequency and severity, use the behaviors identified by the
subquestions as most aberrant. For example, if the caregiver indicates that resistive behavior is
particularly problematic when you are asking the subquestions of the agitation section, then use
resistive behavior to prompt judgments regarding the frequency and severity of agitation. If two
behaviors are very problematic, use the frequency and severity of both behaviors to score the item.
For example, if the patient has two or more types of delusions, then use the severity and frequency of
all delusional behaviors to phrase the questions regarding severity and frequency.
In some cases, the caregiver will provide a positive response to the screening question and a
negative reply to all subquestions. If this happens, ask the caregiver to expand on why they responded affirmatively to the screen. If they provide information relevant to the behavioral domain but
in different terms, the behavior should be scored for severity and frequency as usual. If the original
affirmative response was erroneous, leading to a failure to endorse any subquestions, then the
behavior is changed to "NO" on the screen.
Some sections such as the questions pertaining to appetite are framed so as to capture
whether there is an increase or decrease in the behavior (increased or decreased appetite or weight).
If the caregiver answer "yes" to the first member of the paired question (such as has the patient's
weight decreased?), do not ask the second question (has the patient's weight increased?) since the
answer to the second question is contained in the answer to the first. If the caregiver answers "no" to
the first member of the pair of questions, then the second question must be asked.
When determining frequency, say to the person being interviewed “Now I want to find out
how often these things [define using description of the behaviors they noted as most problematic on
the subquestions] occur. Would you say that they occur less than once per week, about once per
week, several times per week but not every day, or essentially every day?” Some behaviors, such as
apathy eventually become continuously present, and then “are constantly present” can be substituted
for “every day.” When determining severity, tell the person being interviewed “Now I would like to find
out how severe these behaviors are. By severity, I mean how disturbing or disabling they are for the
patient. Would you say that [the behaviors] are mild, moderate, or marked?” Additional descriptors
are provided in each section that may be used to help the interviewer clarify each grade of severity.
In each case, be sure that the caregiver provides you with a definite answer as to the frequency and
severity of the behaviors. Do not guess what you think the caregiver would say based on your
discussion. We have found it helpful to provide the caregiver with a piece of paper on which is
written the frequency and severity descriptions (less than once per week, about once per week,
several times per week and daily or continuously for frequency and mild, moderate, and severe for
severity) to allow them to visually see the response alternatives. This also saves the examiner from
reiterating the alternatives with each question.
In very impaired patients or patients with special medical circumstances, a set of questions
may not be applicable. For example, bed-bound patients may exhibit hallucinations or agitation but
could not exhibit aberrant motor behavior. If the clinician or the caregiver believes that the questions
are inappropriate, then the section should be marked NA (upper right corner of each section), and no
further data are not recorded for the section. Likewise, if the clinician feels that the responses are
invalid (e.g., the caregiver did not seem to understand the particular set of questions asked), NA
should also be marked.
When each domain is completed and the caregiver has completed the frequency and
severity rating, you may want to ask the associated caregiver distress question if your protocol
includes the distress assessment. To do this, ask the caregiver how much, if any, “emotional or
psychological” distress the behavior he or she just discussed causes him or her (the caregiver). The
caregiver must rate their own distress on a five point scale from 0 - no distress, 1 - minimal, 2 - mild,

3 - moderate, 4 - moderately severe, 5 - very severe or extreme. The distress scale of this instrument was developed by Daniel Kaufer, M.D.
Scoring the NPI
Frequency is rated as:
1 - Occasionally - less than once per week
2 - Often - about once per week
3 - Frequently - several times per week but less than every day
4 - Very frequently - daily or essentially continuously present
Severity is rated as:
1 - Mild - produce little distress in the patient
2 - Moderate - more disturbing to the patient but can be redirected by the caregiver
3 - Marked - very disturbing to the patient and difficult to redirect
The score for each domain is: domain score = frequency x severity
Distress is scored as:
0 - no distress
1 - minimal
2 - mild
3 - moderate
4 - moderately severe
5 - very severe to extreme
Thus, for each behavioral domain there are four scores:
• Frequency
• Severity
• Total (frequency x severity)
• Caregiver distress
A total NPI score can be calculated by adding all domain scores together. The distress score is
not included in the total NPI score.
Instructional Videotape
An instructional videotape demonstrating the use of the NPI is available through the UCLA
Alzheimer's Disease Center, Neuropsychiatric Institute, 740 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, California, 90024. The cost of the videotape is $25.00 (subject to change).

BACKGROUND

1.1.

CDISC SDTM/ADaM Pilot Project

The CDISC SDTM/ADaM Pilot Project team will produce a case study to demonstrate
the effective transformation of legacy data into CDISC SDTM domains and ADaM
datasets and their associated metadata. The resulting “pilot submission” will be delivered
to FDA reviewers for their evaluation in a mock review, assessing whether data
submitted to the FDA using the CDISC Standard will meet the needs and expectations of
both medical and statistical FDA reviewers.
The pilot submission will include SDTM datasets, analysis datasets, all relevant
metadata, analysis results, and an abbreviated report (including only the necessary
documentation).
The legacy data being used in CDISCPILOT01 were provided by Eli Lilly and Company
(Legacy Sponsor) for the purposes of this pilot project. The data were de-identified and
documents were redacted prior to release to the pilot project team.
The submission will not reproduce all of the Legacy Sponsor’s analyses and reports.
Instead only the more common elements of a submission will be addressed. These will
include safety data, the primary outcome, and at least one secondary outcome. A
representative set of analyses will be chosen. Deviations from the protocol-specified
analyses are described in Appendix 1. Additional variables and flags may be included in
the analysis datasets, but may not be used in the analyses included in the report.

1.2.

Description of Clinical Study

Study Title: Safety and Efficacy of the Xanomeline Transdermal Therapeutic System
(TTS) in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease.
The study was a prospective, randomized, multi-center (17), double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group study. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of transdermal xanomeline, 50 cm2 and 75 cm2, and placebo in patients with
mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.
Xanomeline or placebo was administered daily in the morning, with the application of
two adhesive patches, one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25 cm2 in area. Doses were measured
in terms of the xanomeline base, and were 54mg for the 50 cm2 patch and 27mg for the
25 cm2 patch. Placebo was identical in appearance to the primary study material. The
total doses being compared are therefore 0 (both patches placebo), 54mg (large patch
active drug, small patch placebo), and 81mg (both patches active drug). The treatment
groups referred to throughout the pilot submission will be “xanomeline high dose,”
“xanomeline low dose,” and “placebo”.

CDISCPILOT01

Patients were males or females of non-childbearing potential, 50 years of age or older,
had probable Alzheimer’s disease according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, and an
MMSE score of 10 to 23. The duration of treatment was 26 weeks, with 24 weeks of
active treatment. A total of 295 patients were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups:
xanomeline high dose, 97 patients; xanomeline low dose, 98 patients; and placebo, 100
patients; 166 were females and 129 were males.

PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS PLAN

This analysis plan describes the analyses to be performed in the context of the first
iteration of the CDISC SDTM/ADaM Pilot Submission, CDISCPILOT01. It should be
noted that this document is not meant to represent all of the measures assessed or
analyses performed in the original study.

STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) AND ENDPOINT(S)

3.1.

Study Objective(s)

3.1.1.

Primary

The primary objectives of this study are
•

To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 error
rate, α=.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores,
and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]).

•

To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.

3.1.2.

Secondary

A secondary objective of this study is:
•

To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the
Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
areas.

Statistical Hypotheses

The statistical hypotheses for the 2 primary endpoints are based on the primary analysis,
which is a test for dose response. The primary analysis for ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24
is based on an ANCOVA model, which includes the baseline score, site, and treatment as
continuous variable. The statistical hypothesis is:
H0: b = 0, where b is the coefficient for treatment
H1: b ≠ 0, where b is the coefficient for treatment
The primary analysis for CIBIC+ at Week 24 is based on an ANOVA model which
includes site and treatment as continuous variable. The statistical hypothesis is:
H0: b = 0, where b is the coefficient for treatment
H1: b ≠ 0, where b is the coefficient for treatment

4.

STUDY DESIGN

Patients with probable mild to moderate AD will be studied in a randomized, doubleblind, parallel (3 arm), placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks duration. The study will be
conducted on an outpatient basis. Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled.

SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS

Approximately 100 patients will be randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups.
Previous experience with the oral formulation of xanomeline suggests that this sample
size has 90% power to detect a 3.0 mean treatment difference in ADAS-Cog (p<.05, twosided), based on a standard deviation of 6.5. Furthermore, this sample size has 80%
power to detect a 0.36 mean treatment difference in CIBIC+ (p<.05, two-sided), based on
a standard deviation of 0.9.

6.

ANALYSIS POPULATIONS

For this study, the following definitions are used:
Patients entered into the study are those from whom informed
Screen Failures
consent for the study has been obtained. Patients entered into
the study but not assigned to a treatment group are considered to
be screen failures. Demographic data for screen failures will be
included in the data tabulation datasets, but not in the analysis
datasets or in the analyses.
Randomized

Patients who are enrolled in the study are those who have been
assigned to a treatment group. Patients who are entered into the
study but fail to meet criteria specified in the protocol for
treatment assignment will not be enrolled in the study.
Patients are randomly assigned to treatment groups at Week 0
(Visit 3).

ITT Population

All patients randomized

Safety population

All patients randomized and known to have taken at least one
dose of randomized drug

Efficacy population

All patients who were randomized and took drug, and have at
least 1 post-baseline measure for both ADAS-Cog and CIBIC+

Completers

All patients in the efficacy population who completed their
Week 24 visit (Visit 12).

7.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DATA ANALYSES

All statistical tests will be 2-sided with a significance level of 0.05. One-sided p-values
will not be reported. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number
of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Summary
statistics for categorical variables will include the frequency and percentage.

7.1.

CDISCPILOT01

Multi-center Studies

Sites that enroll fewer than 3 patients in any one treatment group will be grouped
together, with a new pooled site identifier assigned for the purpose of analysis. If this
combination still results in a treatment group having fewer than 3 patients in any one
treatment group, then this group of patients will be combined with the next fewest
enrolling site. In the event that there is a tie for fewest-enrolling site, one of these will be
chosen at random by a random-number generator.

7.2.

Examination of Subgroups

The effect of gender upon efficacy will be evaluated if sample sizes are sufficient to
warrant such analyses.
Covariates for age, race, baseline disease severity as measured by MMSE, and patient
education level will be included in analysis datasets as appropriate for exploratory
analysis.

7.3.

Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity

There are 2 primary efficacy endpoints in this study, each of which will be tested at a
significance level of 0.05. No adjustments for multiple primary endpoints will be made.
Nominal 2-sided p-values will be reported for each primary efficacy endpoint.
The primary analyses for the 2 primary efficacy endpoints will be a test for dose
response. Within each primary efficacy endpoint, 3 sets of pairwise comparisons for the
2 active treatment groups and placebo will only be performed if the test for dose response
is significant.

8.

DATA HANDLING CONVENTIONS

“End of treatment” will refer to the subject’s Week 24 visit or early termination visit.
“End of study” will refer to the subject’s Week 26 visit or early termination visit.

8.1.

Early Termination and Missing Data

If possible, data for subjects who terminated the study early will be collected at the
scheduled Week 24 visit.
Laboratory values collected after the discontinuation of study drug will be used. The
assessment date will be compared with the last dose of study drug to determine if the
assessment was made within the defined washout period and a flag will be set to indicate
this status.
Missing postbaseline efficacy values will be imputed using last observation carried
forward (LOCF). Missing baseline values and missing safety data will not be imputed.
For the efficacy data, the last observation carried forward will be based on the targeted
assessments (i.e. those assigned to be the analyzable assessment based on the assessment
windows).

CDISCPILOT01

Assessment Windows

In general, assessments will be assigned to visits as collected on the CRFs, and will
disregard the actual date of the assessment. For example, if an assessment is recorded on
the Visit 10 CRF page, the assessment will be assigned to Week 16 (Visit 10).
The ADAS-Cog (11), CIBIC+, and NPI-X assessments will also be assigned to visits
based on the actual visit dates, as will laboratory assessments. Actual visit days will be
determined relative to the date of randomization, using the algorithm {day = visit date –
randomization date}. If multiple assessments fall into the same visit window (windows
defined in following table), then the assessment closest to the target day will be selected.
[Note that retrieval visits (visit number 201) are included for the purpose of selecting
assessments for the week 24 visit window.] If two assessments are equidistant from the
target day, then the assessment prior to the target day will be selected. In situations
where imputation of missing values is also involved, imputation will use the targeted
assessments within the windows.

Laboratory Data

Multiple laboratory assessments within visit/week windows may be collected. In part,
this will be a function of safety monitoring procedures as described in the protocol.
Additional and unscheduled labs may also be collected for other reasons. Only planned
laboratory values collected at scheduled visits are used for analysis. Additional lab
values will be included in datasets, but not incorporated into analyses. A flag will be set
to indicate the last on-treatment (prior to or at week 24) observation for each lab
parameter.
A change from baseline laboratory value will be calculated as the difference between the
baseline lab value and the endpoint value (i.e., the value at the specified visit) and the end
of treatment observation.
In addition, each laboratory value, including the baseline value, will be categorized with
reference to the lab normal range as
• “L” - less than or equal to the lower limit of normal
• “N” – Greater than the Lower Limit of Normal and less than the Upper Limit of
Normal
• “H” – Greater than or equal to the Upper Limit of Normal.
Laboratory values will be assigned a flag of abnormal (high or low) if the value is outside
the threshold range (defined as significantly beyond the normal range, i.e., >1.5*ULN or
<.5*LLN) or if the value is significantly different from the value observed at the
preceding scheduled visit (i.e., absolute value of the change from previous value is larger
than the 50% of the normal range, ULN-LLN). In addition, the ratio of the value to its
LLN (i.e., value/LLN) and to its ULN (i.e., value/ULN) will be calculated for inclusion in
the datasets, but not analyzed. These ratios will allow a quick searching for subjects with
values greater than 1.5*ULN, for example, without the use of additional flags.
A separate analysis dataset will be provided containing the lab parameters needed for the
assessment of Hy’s Law. An abnormal flag will be assigned to indicate whether a subject
meets the criteria for a modified Hy’s Law assessment of liver function, defined as:
1.
Transaminase (SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST) elevations (i.e., >1.5*ULN) and
2.
Bilirubin elevated to greater than 1.5*ULN.

8.4.

Values of Clinical Concern

8.4.1.

Laboratory Values

Laboratory values will be assigned a flag of abnormal if the value is significantly beyond
the normal range or if the value is significantly different from the proceeding value.
In addition, elevated liver function values will be used to trigger retesting and possible
discontinuation of study drug as described in the protocol. These values of clinical
concern are:
• Patients with ALT/SGPT levels >120 IU

STUDY POPULATION

9.1.

Disposition of Subjects

The number of subjects randomized, number of subjects in the ITT population, number of
subjects in the safety population and number of subjects in the efficacy population will be
summarized by treatment group. The number and percentage of subjects who complete
the study as well as subjects who withdraw prematurely from the study will be displayed.
The reasons for early termination will be summarized.
Fisher’s exact test will be used to analyze 3 reasons for study discontinuation (protocol
completed, lack of efficacy, and adverse event).

9.2.

Demographic and Baseline Characteristics

The following will be summarized by treatment group and across all treatment groups.
•

Age

•

Age category (<65, 65-80, >80)

•

Sex

•

Race

•

Mini-Mental State

•

Duration of disease [computed as months between date of Week -2 (Visit 1) and
date of onset of the first definite symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease]

•

Years of education

•

Weight, height, BMI at Baseline (Visit 3 for weight and BMI, Visit 1 for height)

•

BMI category (BMI<25, BMI 25-<30, BMI>=30)

The treatment groups will be compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous
variables and by Pearson’s chi-square test for categorical variables. Note that because
patients are randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups, any statistically significant
treatment group differences are by definition a Type I error; however, the resulting pvalues will be used as another descriptive statistic to help focus possible additional
analyses (for example, analysis of covariance, subset analyses) on those factors that are
most imbalanced (that is, that have the smallest p-values).
Baseline comparisons across treatment groups for the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) will be made using analysis of variance with treatment and site as main effects.

EFFICACY ANALYSES

Refer to Section 15.1 (Deviations from Protocol-Specified Efficacy Analyses) for a
description of how these analyses differ from the protocol-specified efficacy analyses.
A key difference from the protocol is that efficacy assessments are considered valid even
if they occur while off study drug.

Primary Efficacy Endpoints

10.1.1.

ADAS-COG (11)

The primary analysis of the ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 will use the efficacy population
with LOCF imputation for any missing values at Week 24. A secondary analysis will be
performed for the Week 24 endpoint using the completers subset using observed data.
For each of these analyses, an ANCOVA model will be used with the baseline score, site,
and treatment included as independent variables. Treatment will be included as a
continuous variable, and results for a test of dose response will be produced. Interaction
terms will not be investigated. If the test for dose response is statistically significant,
pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups will be performed and evaluated at a
significance level of 0.05.
Summary statistics will be generated for each visit including baseline using the efficacy
population with LOCF imputation. The visits for ADAS-Cog (11) are baseline (Week 0),
Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24.
A supportive analysis for the ADAS-Cog (11) will use a likelihood-based repeated
measures (MMRM) analysis. In this analysis for the change from baseline in the ADASCog (11) at Week 24, the independent variables included in the model are the fixed,
categorical effects of treatment, site, time (week), and treatment by time interaction along
with the continuous effects of baseline ADAS-Cog (11) score and baseline ADAS-Cog
(11) score by time interaction. Barring a computational singularity, an unstructured
covariance matrix will be used to model the within-subject errors in the MMRM analysis.
The unstructured covariance matrix is chosen to allow the analysis to be unconstrained by
the structure of the covariance. If there is any computational singularity, a Toeplitz
covariance matrix will be used. The Toeplitz covariance structure provides reasonable
flexibility in estimating correlation between visits.
Additional details regarding scoring and methods for handling missing data for ADASCog (11) are in Appendix 1 of this analysis plan.

CIBIC+

The primary analysis of CIBIC+ at Week 24 will use the efficacy population with LOCF
imputation for any missing values at Week 24. For this endpoint, an ANOVA model will
be used with site and treatment included as independent variables. Interaction terms will
not be investigated. Treatment will be included as a continuous variable, and results for a
test of dose response will be produced. If the test for dose response is statistically
significant, pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups will be performed and evaluated at
a significance level of 0.05.
Summary statistics will be generated for each visit using the efficacy population with
LOCF imputation. The visits for CIBIC+ are Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24.
Additional details regarding scoring for CIBIC+ are in Appendix 1 of this analysis plan.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

10.2.1.

NPI-X

The primary analysis of mean NPI-X total score from Week 4 to Week 24 will use the
efficacy population. This endpoint will be calculated as the mean of all available total
scores between Weeks 4 and 24, inclusive. For this endpoint, an ANCOVA model will
be used with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables.
Interaction terms will not be investigated. Treatment will be included as a continuous
variable, and results for a test of dose response will be produced. If the test for dose
response is statistically significant, pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups will be
performed and evaluated at a significance level of 0.05.
The visits for NPI-X are baseline (Week 0), Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10
(telephone), Week 12, Week 14 (telephone), Week 16, Week 18 (telephone), Week 20,
Week 22 (telephone), Week 24, Week 26.
Additional details regarding scoring and methods for handling missing data for NPI-X are

SAFETY ANALYSES

11.1.

Extent of Exposure

Average daily dose and cumulative dose at end of study (Week 26 or early termination)
will be computed for each subject. Summary statistics will be computed for each of the
above quantities for each treatment group.

11.2.

Adverse Events

For this submission, the adverse events will be recoded according to MedDRA.
Treatment emergent adverse events will be cross-tabulated by System Organ Class (SOC)

and preferred term (PT). Please refer to Appendix 15.5 for additional information about
the MedDRA coding. The incidence of treatment emergent events grouped under
preferred terms for each active treatment will be compared to placebo using Fisher’s
exact test. Treatment emergent adverse events are defined relative to the date of first
dose [Week 0 (Visit 3) unless indicated otherwise] as
•

events with a start date that is equal to or greater than the date of first dose

•

events that start prior to the date of first dose and worsen after that date

•

events that start and resolve prior to the date of first dose, but then recur after that
the date of first dose.

If the recording of an adverse event start date is not complete, imputation of the start date
will be done in a conservative manner. Adverse events will be considered treatment
emergent if the year and/or the month is the same as the treatment start year and month.
In the case of a completely missing adverse event start date, the start date will be imputed
as the day of first dose. No imputation of adverse events dates where the partial date
clearly indicates a start prior to the beginning of treatment will be done.
Due to the formulation of the clinical path, it is anticipated that there may be an increase
in adverse events that are associated with the application of the skin path. For this
reason, additional analysis of dermatological adverse events will be conducted. A
category of special events will be created to identify the events that are considered
dermatological events. These events will be determined by the medical review of blinded
coded adverse event terms and all preferred terms that are considered to be dermatologic
in nature, such as rash, pruritus, or dermatitis, will be flagged as adverse events of special
interest. A complete list of preferred terms that are considered to be dermatologic events
will be provided in the final analysis. The time to the first dermatological event will be
compared across the treatment groups using Kaplan-Meier methods. Graphical displays
of the survival curves will be presented.

11.3.

Deaths and Serious Adverse Events

Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized by SOC and PT. Incidence of SAEs
will be compared between active drug groups and placebo, again using Fisher’s exact
test.

11.4.
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of
Investigational Product and/or Withdrawal from the Study and Other
Significant Adverse Events
For this submission, no formal summarization of adverse events leading to
discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be conducted. The analysis data will
provide variables to identify these adverse events.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

Hematology, and clinical chemistry will be summarized for Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 6,
8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 26 (Visits 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, respectively).
Urinalysis and other lab data will not be summarized, but will be included in the
tabulation datasets. The baseline values will be those collected at Week -2 (Visit 1).
Four assessments of abnormality will be identified for each laboratory analyte, as
described in Section 8.4.1:
• Values outside the normal range
• Values significantly beyond the normal range (i.e., outside the threshold range)
• Values differing significantly from values at the previous scheduled visit,
• Abnormal values as defined by Hy’s Law
The number of subjects with no abnormal measure during treatment and those with at
least one abnormal measure during treatment will be summarized for each lab analyte.
Two tables will be provided – one defining abnormal as beyond normal range (i.e, below
LLN or above ULN) and the other defining abnormal as a clinically significant change
from the previous visit. Fisher’s exact test will be used to analyze the incidence of
abnormal (high or low) measures during the post-randomization phase.
A display summarizing shifts from baseline by week in terms of abnormality based on
threshold range will be provided. The data will be summarized using sets of 3x3 matrices
comparing baseline and on drug categorization for each treatment group for each week
for each laboratory analyte.
Shift tables summarizing whether or not a subject’s status changed from baseline during
the treatment period will be provided for changes based on threshold ranges and changes
based on Hy’s Law. In these tables a subject will be categorized as normal or abnormal
(i.e., outside the threshold range) at baseline. During the treatment phase, the most
extreme value will be used to categorize a patient as normal or abnormal during the
treatment phase. The shift table will show the number of patients whose on treatment
categorization was the same or shifted from the baseline categorization. The treatment
perod is defined as any planned visit after Week 0 (Visit 3), up to and including Week 24
(Visit 12). A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratifying by status at baseline, will
be performed.

11.6.

Other Safety Measures

Vital sign data (blood pressure supine, blood pressure standing 1 minute, blood pressure
standing 3 minutes, heart rate supine, heart rate standing 1 minute, and heart rate standing
3 minutes) at baseline and Week 24 and end of treatment (last visit on or before Week 24
visit) will be summarized by treatment group. Change from baseline will also be
summarized.
Weight data at baseline and Week 24 (with and without including early terminations) will
be summarized by treatment group. Change from baseline will also be summarized.

The concomitant medication data will be coded using a publicly available sample of
WHO Drug. Drugs not matching those in the sample will be considered “uncoded” for
the purposes of this submission. The number and percent of subjects receiving each
concomitant medication will be summarized. Concomitant medications will be reported
by Body System and ingredient. Medications will be sorted in descending order of total
incidence across treatment groups for the Body System and in descending order of total
incidence for the ingredient within each Body System. If the total incidence for any two
or more ingredients is equal, the events will be presented in alphabetical order.

CIBIC+

This assessment has a 7-point scale and is scored as:
1 = Marked improvement,
2= Moderate improvement,
3= Minimal improvement,
4 = No change,
5= Minimal worsening,
6= Moderate worsening
7 = Marked worsening

14.1.3.

NPI-X

The primary assessment of this instrument will be for the total score, not including the
sleep, appetite, and euphoria domains. This total score is computed by taking the product
of the frequency and severity scores and summing them up across the domains.
Severity:
Range 1-3
1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked
Frequency:
Range 1-4
1 = occasionally, 2 = often, 3 = frequently, 4 = very frequently
Can be treated as continuous variables
Frequency × Severity for each NPI domain
Range 0-12

FINAL SAP

- 45 -

CDISC SDTM/ADaM Pilot Project

CDISCPILOT01

NPI-X Total (9) will be calculated as the sum of all individual domain scores (can be
treated as continuous variable). If the domain is absent, then the score for the domain is 0.
If the domain is not applicable then the score for the domain is set to missing. The range
of NPI-X Total (9) is 0-108.
NPI-X Total (9) domains are:
• Delusions
• Hallucinations
• Agitation/Aggression
• Depression/Dysphoria
• Anxiety
• Apathy/Indifference
• Disinhibition
• Irritability/Lability
• Aberrant Motor Behavior

14.2.

Handling missing item scores within efficacy data

The following applies to all totals and subtotals of ADAS-Cog(11) and NPI-X, and does
not apply to CIBIC+.
Any computed total score will be treated as missing if more than 30% of the items are
missing or scored “not applicable”. For example, when computing ADAS-Cog(11), if 4
or more items are missing, then the total score will not be computed. When one or more
items are missing (but not more than 30%), the total score will be adjusted in order to
maintain the full range of the scale. For example, ADAS-Cog(11) is a 0-70 scale. If the
first item, Word Recall (ranges from 0 to 10), is missing, then the remaining 10 items of
the ADAS-Cog(11) will be summed and multiplied by (70 / (70-10) ), or 7/6.

APPENDIX 2 – DEVIATIONS FROM PROTOCOLSPECIFIED ANALYSES

Some analyses specified in the original protocol will not be performed for the purposes of
this pilot project. Where applicable, deviations are noted in the appropriate sections of
this analysis plan. Otherwise, deviations from the protocol-specified analyses are
described below.

15.1.

Deviations from Protocol-Specified Efficacy Analyses

The following efficacy endpoints will not be used: ADAS-Cog (14) and DAD. ANOVA
and ANCOVA models for the efficacy endpoints will not assess site*treatment
interaction. Furthermore, the normality assumption for the efficacy endpoints will not be
investigated and consideration for rank transformations will not be done.
The protocol proposes a number of secondary analyses for the efficacy endpoints. The
following secondary analyses will not be performed:
•

Observed cases at each timepoint for ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+.

•

Average of all postrandomization NPI-X scorces including Weeks 2 and 26.

•

Dichotomizing subjects for each behavior in the NPI-X instrument into those who
experienced the behavior for the first time postrandomization and those who had
the quotient between frequency and severity increase relative to baseline versus
those who did not.

The protocol states that efficacy assessments are invalid if no study drug has been taken
within 3 days prior to the assessment. This will not be considered in the pilot project. In
addition, efficacy assessments occurring after the last dose of drug will be considered for
windowing and for the efficacy analysis if they are collected at visit number 201.
Interim analyses will not be performed.
Covariate analyses examining the effect of Apo E on the efficacy measures will not be
performed.

15.2.
Deviations from Protocol-Specified Pharmacokinetic
Analyses
Pharmacokinetic analyses will not be performed.

15.3.

Deviations from Protocol-Specified Safety Analyses

ECG analyses will not be performed.

The caregiver's response about the patch will not be summarized.
No ANCOVA analyses will be performed for laboratory data. Instead, frequency tables
based on the on-treatment period will include p-values.

15.4.

OMISSIONS FROM LEGACY DATA

The data reflected in the submitted datasets will not include all of the subjects in the
legacy data. This is because we do not have all of the data for the remaining subjects, so
chose to omit them as we have an adequate number of subjects left for the purposes of the
pilot.
The lab data included many analytes. Because of the large size of the datasets, it was
decided to reduce these datasets by dropping less common analytes from the datasets.
This was done by comparing the lab tests performed to a list of common lab tests found
on the CDISC web site. Lab tests not in this list of common tests were dropped. In
addition, lab tests with character results only were dropped, to simplify the analyses
provided. These include “RBC Morphology,” “elliptocytosis,” “basophilic stippling,”
and “target cells.”

15.5.

Coding of Adverse Events

Due to licensing restrictions for MedDRA, all of the event terms, including verbatim text,
LLT, PT, HLT, HLGT, and SOC were initially masked. Discussions with MSSO
resulted in an agreement that all can be unmasked with the exception of HLT and HLGT,
as long as text is what is provided and not the actual MedDRA numeric code. In the
processing of providing the unmasking, it was simpler to also leave the verbatim text
masked. Consequently, the SOC, PT, and LLT are real (i.e., not masked).

Title:
Documentation of Statistical Methods

This document contains raw statistical output for the two primary efficacy analyses and
for the repeated measures analysis. In addition to the statistical output, the summary
tables generated from the statistical analysis are also included. Because this document
was provided in response to a request from the FDA, it was decided that this approach
would allow the dates on the corresponding tables to be consistent, as well illustrate that
nothing changed from the table included in the original package.
Supporting Table 14-3.01 contains the raw statistical output from the dose response
analysis and the treatment comparison analysis, supporting Table 14-3.01, “Primary
Endpoint Analysis: ADAS Cog (11) - Change from Baseline to Week 24 – LOCF.”
Supporting Table 14-3.02 contains the raw statistical output from the dose response
analysis and the treatment comparison analysis, supporting Table 14-3.02, “Primary
Endpoint Analysis: CIBIC+ - Summary at Week 24 - LOCF.”
Supporting Table 14-3.11 contains the raw statistical output from the repeated measures
analysis, supporting Table 14-3.11, “ADAS Cog (11) - Repeated Measures Analysis of
